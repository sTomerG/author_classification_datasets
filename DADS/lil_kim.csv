[Lil' Kim]
Every word I utter, I feel strictly gutter
That's why I touch more green than Tiger's putter
So you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna
I ain't worried 'bout none of ya and I'll say it in front of ya
I hear the snakes hiss, talkin reckless
Thought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street, y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
I guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called ""Wankstas""
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong, I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds
I'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head
Come down with my weave straight sittin on bread
At the gate, gettin picked up in a new Coupe {?}

[Hook One: Lil' Kim]
""It's all good"" - If you drivin or ridin the bus
""It's all good"" - In the struggle and the times is tough
""It's all good"" - It don't matter you can ride with us
""It's all good"" - It's all good
""It's all good"" - If you hustlin and huggin the block
""It's all good"" - Workin 9 to 5, punchin the clock
""It's all good"" - It don't matter how you get that guap
""It's all good"" - It's all good

[Lil' Kim]
See I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail
It's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell
The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with luh up in the chocha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy
At age 14 I was puttin' on weight
At age 16 I was movin' the weight
Gettin paid for drivin' state to state
Smugglin' weight, prayin I don't bump into Jake
I travelled through a few places with the burners
In the suitcases, thank God for Big
Damn right I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all

[Hook Two: Lil' Kim]
""It's all good"" - Niggas run around stuntin and frontin
""It's all good"" - Talkin shit but ain't sayin nuttin
""It's all good"" - It's aight cause they time is comin
""It's all good"" - It's all good
""It's all good"" - They hatin on me but they copy my style
""It's all good"" - Cracked a smile when they saw me on trial
""It's all good"" - You know you can't keep a good bitch down
""It's all good"" - It's all good

[Lil' Kim]
Cowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down
I come through like two airplanes in midtown
Nigga my get back's the get down
Hit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down
They all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down
Faggots violated I wish they'd try now
Just watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up
Punks gettin left off right where I pick up
Picture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue
Shoot game official like a ref with a whistle
You know when I do it I'm doin it monumental
Leave you speechless kinda like an instrumental
They ask me if I know what true happiness
Do I ever feel regret for all the things I did?
Hell no I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all

"[Verse 1: Lil' Kim & Lil' Shanice]
My Aunt Dot
Left a Glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
Even though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece
Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
What? She don't know I like my guns pretty?
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies
I heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you?
Whattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?
She called me by my government name, Kimberly
Who sent you?
My mom sent me; her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie
Hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match
Bvlgari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
And I could see she was admiring my mink ski suit
Then she handed me the note
Here, read this
I just stared her up and down
'Cause I couldn't believe this, then I opened it
It said, ""Bitches is out to get you
Your so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz
I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
They know where you live, so evacuate the crib
And oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice
Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her
Besides she looks up to you, you're her idol
And tomorrow is her first violin recital
And she would be, more than happy if you could take her
Peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later""
Damn, what went wrong?
Can't we all just get along, and make hit songs?
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show, y'all hoes would get ""gonged""
'Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
What the fuck you waitin' for? C'mon, let's get it on
What? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future
To bring back your head like Medusa

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & Lil' Shanice]
Uhh, we in the Range in this fucked up weather
It's snowin' and I'm tryin' to put the whole shit together
How Laverne, she always wanted to be like me
And dress like me, and look like me
And Nicole, it's like she lived in my house
Askin me for money, day in - day out
And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha
C'mon Shanice I'm takin' you to my house in L. Conn
(I wanna go with you!) Uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine
C'mon please, I wanna be just like you
600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barettes and
H-class rocks inside my Baby G Shock
Fuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes, X-and-O's
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'R'Us
Make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
I'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-C-the-E
But all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what? I like the green, know what I mean?
Ever seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I can clean
You know what? I like you, little big person
But rule number one, no cursin'
Anyway, what you know about that?
You too young for that, when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
So she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
""Hello?"" Yo, what's the deal?
Why these bitches buggin' out;
I mean, what's this all about?
""See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They don't want you to win no more
Soul Train they don't want you to attend no more
And I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
The other day, when I was comin' out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door""
For real? ""Yup, then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat
Then I dumped her on a dead-end street
The other two? Yeah they still linger
But don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
So just pray I come home
And when we hang up, get rid of your phone""
Whoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
It's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another
Hmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin' white, no sex
And when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
'Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
Is the reason why the story is to be continued

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)",Lil’ Kim,Lil’ Shanice
"[Verse]
Niggas call me Blanco like the mob out here (Mob out here)
We overseas, they like ""How you get them Glocks out here?""
I got killas in different countries, you know squad out here
Feed a lot of wolves, watch it how you talk out here
""Fuck Lil' Kim"", that's all I hear is people talkin' evil
""Fuck Lil' Kim"", if you say that then, bitch, I better not see you
""Fuck Lil' Kim"", bitch, watch your mouth before they can't ID you
Laid up in ICU where nobody can come see you
Why these bitches think they safe because I'm not out?
You know any given time Kimmy could pop out
Every time I see these chicks they quick to cop out
IG got these hoes thinkin' that they got clout (Ahh)
Get yo' ass back in that house, we got No Limit tanks
Master P dropped that shit off last night, we pullin' rank
Never talk when gangstas talk unless you 'bout that action
My track record'll tell you bitches I ain't just rappin'
This Dior coat is the only one, so you can't jack it
I'm a masterpiece, wrapped me on his arm like a bust-down Patek
Niggas flexin' on the 'Gram, but they be broke (They be broke)
Smokin' on 'em blunts, but don't want no smoke
Never care so much right now, my paper's stackin' up (Stackin' up)
I'm in my Louis bag, you hoes could pack it up (Pack it up)
Y'all both got knocked, he in, you out, it ain't adding up (Ain't addin' up)
But you say you keep it gangsta, nigga, that's cap or what? (Cap or what?)
Big and Pac'd be alive right now if you niggas ain't gassed shit up
If I knew who did it, I'd personally wrap they caskets up
I'ma keep Frank name alive, my nigga ain't die for nothin'
Got shooters out in Brooklyn ready to die for nothin'
These rats runnin' round in this jungle, lyin' for nothin'
Be careful we got apes out here, eat you alive for nothin'

[Outro]
We on our Royal Fam shit, you heard?
Thank you, come again
Gang, gang, gang

Uh, it's going out to all the pimps and macs

Playa playaz, playa, playa, let these hoes know

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is it true, all I wanna do is screw?
Drink brew, with the crew, on the avenue? Ooh!
I flip skins like Mary Lou
So what ya gonna do when (Biggie) come for you, boo
I got girls that look like Toni Braxton
And give me the skins without askin'
When I'm relaxin’ on my back and you know what time it is, uh
But if it's red man, I'll leave it alone
She can call me on my cellular phone
And I mess around and pick you up
Take you to the crib, stick you up
Put on my Silk CD and lick you up and down
'Til you say stop, hit the twat, 'til your pops call the cops
And when I make bail outta jail, I'ma wail on that tail (Why, Big?)
Because the sex never fails, I am

[Chorus: Erick Sermon, The Notorious B.I.G., & Lil' Kim]
So amazing (Uh)
So amazing (Uh)
So amazing (Playa, playa)
And I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons (Baby)
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & Jagged Edge]
Biggie taught me how to ride dick
Cut ’em off, freeze ’em, them use 'em as ice picks
Hard times, baby; got honeys out of state
Doing 2-to-8 for first degree rape
What I can’t get, I take
Her name hold weight (What you say?)
Like I said: my name hold weight (Uh), pussy is the bait (Uh)
Around the way they call me the Pink Panther
I'm your private dancer
If he giving up the bread, I'm taking him home
He can lick me like an ice cream cone
Pop that coochie like I'm a loog boochie (Oww)
Tap her on the booty ’til he sweat out my doody
Niggas show up with 10 carats in the ring
You know I got that thing that make a nigga wanna sing:
""Girl, let's just get married, I just want to get married""
That's why they call me the queen, 'cause I am

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
This is going out to the pimps and macs (Uh, uh)
That hit skins 'til their broad catch a asthma attack
But not even Pamatti Miss could resist
The way Lil' Kim put this on your lips
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom
Let's smoke a little boom and head straight to the bedroom
And then I whisper soft in the ear
Yeah, I love you too, my Big Poppa Bear
You know I leave you pussy-whipped
I whip that pussy
Well, hit it from the back 'til it get real gushy, baby
Good sex is what I'm startin'
I get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'
And I pray that the dick don't slip
'Cause then I'm hearin' this shit (That's not it)
And then I just ride 'til the sun rise
And when I'm done I wipe the cum on her thighs, I am

So amazing (Uh)

"[Intro: RuPaul]
Oh yes, your bitch is back
Just when you thought it was safe to go into the water
Lil' Kim gon' push the shit a little farther
Hey, Lil' Kim, this is RuPaul and I have one thing to say to you
You better work!

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet told him park it
Then I jumps out the Zora, Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R L-S is in the stretch LS
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bulgari perfume from a mile you smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill'
Depending how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites, never get into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes
'Cause we

Bad girl, bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl, uh huh
Bad girl, you bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
You done picked the wrong one to start trouble with
Don't you know who you fucking with?
QB, the bad girl from the ghetto
That bitch rock mics in high heel stilettos
Spiked out chokers, piped out Rovers
We coked up like Coca-Cola
When we come through it's like 12 bulldozers
9 times out of 10 we ain't sober
We takin' over like Frances
Switchin' our styles like the hottest new dances
And we don't give a fuck so we take chances
To get large like breast enhancements
Bitches be hatin', sayin' we freaks
See us in the street, break they neck to speak
I ignore them whores, accept my applause
Then I say ""cheese"" for the paparrazi

[Hook: RuPaul]
Bad girl, bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl, uh huh
Bad girl, you bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl

[Bridge: Lil' Kim]
Hey fellas (what?)
Ain't I a dime? (hell yeah, hell yeah)
Hey sistas (uh huh)
Do I have the tightest rhymes? (hell yeah, hell yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I'm on some freak shit tonight, think I ain't
I hope you don't mind a little ketchup on your frank
Either you with it, or either you ain't
You know how it is when Aunt Dot cock block
I beat my niggas with a whip
I breast feed niggas with my tit
And if I catch my man with a chick
I get on some Lorena Bobbitt shit, what

[Hook: RuPaul]
Bad girl, bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl, uh huh
Bad girl, you bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl

[Outro: RuPaul]
Oh yes the bitch is back
She's a bad bitch
Yeah, don't let the smooth taste fool you
See Little Kim got it goin' on
You better work, bitch

But when she's bad, she's better
Hey, she's a bad girl!",Lil’ Kim,RuPaul
"[Verse 1]
People looking at me different, people looking at me funny
Had to put some distance, had to keep these stank niggas from me
I've been gone for a minute 'cause I was getting to the money
Came from the gutter like a bum boy
Fuck niggas, get money, still, that's the protocol
Yes sir, I'm still hardcore
Numero uno, but you know a bitch'll still draw for her
My fans want an encore
Beach house overseas, that's the meaning of a north shore
I used to move that white boy, Justin Bieber
You a atheist, I’ll make you a believer
Mink dragging on the floor, I'm sayin' fuck PETA like Tara and Amina
I know people wanna see me fall
So I don't fuck with anyone at all
Money'll run from you if you chase it
Just sit back and have some patience
I be dodging them shots like the Matrix
Queen of diamonds, sippin' aces
Got the money in a chokehold, blue faces
And some more mills comin', I can taste it, yeah

Give me that bag, give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag, give me that bag
I'm only here for the bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me

[Verse 2]
I'm a bad gyal, so you know I move in silence
I'm a humble crook, I get your ass booked
And still scream ""Stop the Violence!""
Most hated but I love that
Most underrated but I'm so above that
Cut you with the same knife you put in my back
Try me if you want, you'll be missing more than a hubcap
Now run and tell that to TMZ
It's the principle, don't try to lean on me
And what the fuck is twenty G's?
I get more than that to sip Rosé in VIP
I keep the bag on me like I'm Santa Claus
He feeling on my titties like Diana Ross
I'm so A1, don't really need the sauce
These yellow diamonds really piss a nigga off
Bezel so cold, I gotta thaw it out
Kim put that work and never call out
Dope girls, more than bass in these speakers
Shoebox money, ain't no space for the sneakers
I ain't stressing comments on the internet
I'm just adding commas to a bigger check
I'm just adding diamonds to a new Patek
I keep these haters sick, get them Mucinex

[Chorus]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag, give me that bag
I'm only here for the bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me

[Bridge]
You know I keep the bag on me
Every day I be getting to the money
All my life, I been getting to the money (Oh)
Bitches hating 'cause I'm getting to the money (Oh)
I be getting to the money (Oh)
All of these ones all over the floor, let 'em go (Oh)
All to the door, all to the door (Let 'em go)

Give me that bag, give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag

Twist you backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
Rock Lil' Kim hats and shit
I gets down and dirty for the dough
I got love and B.I.G. know it
He must got the studio bugged
Probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
With the M.A.F.I.A. thugs and all types of heat

Lieutenant takes mad dimes from New York to Anaheim
While you daydream and whine, I just keep gettin' mine

"[Intro: Angie Martinez, Nicki Minaj, and Lil' Kim]
It’s funny ‘cause, you know, we’ve been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean, clearly, you’ve been having this thing with Kim
And I don’t know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you’re a rapper –
And I’m thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming -
Even though you say it’s not specifically about her - that Roman’s Revenge is for Kim
Umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know –
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck want war?
Fed Ex beef straight to your front door
It will be a murder scene
I'm turnin' Pink Friday into Friday the 13th
A'ight you Lil' Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery, this shit stops now
Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last name is what got you your job
You a put together gimmick, something like a collage
Since you puttin on a show, you gon get the applause
Clap, clap, lift ya frame like a fucking garage?
This hood shit you and Drake ain't built for
This the shit this other bitch almost got killed for
I still counting what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keeps spinning like its syndicated
Corny broad I'll leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch, should have been deflated
This ain't a championship fight I been the greatest
See the fact is what you doing... I did it
Lames trying to clone my style and run with it
Thats cool. I was the first one with it
Yous a Lil' Kim wanna be, You just hate to admit it
I'm the blueprint, You ain't nothing brand new
Check ya posters and videos, You will always be number 2
I seen them come. I seen them go. Still I remain
Sweety you on your 14th minute of fame
Im over 10 year strong still running the game
Cut the comparison, I'm in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot... Child please I'm solidified
With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried
Either you high or sippin that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado- Brainstorm
I drop bombs- Flex, Napalms
Black and yellow, we'll pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppes when I step out, posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink like my kitty sayin hello
If I whistle they'll pistol whip you in all 5 boroughs
I'm from Brooklyn I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me?
You the type to run your mouth and then run from me
I'm poppin off in your hood with no company
C'mon, Queens ain't showin you no love
I was there the other night poppin bottles with the thugs
You like Washington heffa I'm Benji
You got a buzz right now, I had a frenzy
Oh yeah welcome to the fam Fendi
You need to stop, you're not hot you're a burning match
That means the end is near soon, copy that?
Oh I see they really got you gassed, like I'm a thing of the past
Betta slow down dummy, you about to crash
Stank pussy ho, I'm givin you a bath
Thermometer in hand and I'm comin for ya ass
Who you think you gettin past?
I see right through you, your whole shit is made of glass

[Clip of Nicki Minaj's 'Right Through Me']

[Verse 2]
I draw back
I'm a Brooklyn thorough bitch, rep for my borough bitch
Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit
I ride out til the wheels fall off
And my niggas squeeze til the last shell go off
Fuck your whole team all I see is a bunch of wierdos
You'sa airhead bitch- scarecrow
Ain't nothin old but my money bitch
This is grown liquid assets
Benjamin's my daddy you Young Money bastards
You and Diddy- sorry bunch of swagger jackers
I mothered you hoes I should claim you on my income taxes
Bobby Fischer in the flesh, taught by the great
So on my next move I'm yellin' checkmate
I smell a massacre
I'm Charles Manson, you don't stand a chance with her
Jeffrey Dahmer and you lookin like lunch to me
Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy
Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
You're hilarious... thanks for all the laughs
You're garbage, so I'm takin out the trash
You? Shit on me?
C'mon baby girl- Ain't enough ass shots in the world
You're a nuisance, you'd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me
So chuck it up deuces
All around the world I ball like a ball team
I stack chips, call me Miss Rothstein
Tricks is for kids silly rabbit you're my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring

[Outro: Lil Kim mocking Nicki Minaj]
""I mean I know... I know you guys asked me if Roman’s Revenge was about Kim...
And no, I, it’s not about Kim...
Actually if Kim thought it was about her, I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry, I apologize, Kim

It's my money, boy my money
I bet you'll never ever get another dime from me
No you can't use the phone, baby
I think you need to get your own
Was looking for a man to hold me down
So how did I end up with you? (yeah, with you)
And as hard as I try
Sometimes is getting hard, paying all these bills
The note on my car, so I don't need no broke broke boy, trying to holler
So baby shut it up till you show me the dollars

The feds is watchin me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched

Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides

I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya

I can't put these - cars in a box with the ashes
I can't take these diamonds with me when I die
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you, would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you, hate dyin - but you gon' die a hater
I got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
Y'all nearsighted, lotta y'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light - baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green - don't know whether to stop or go

Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time

What is her type, I wanna give it to her, tell her please
Be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires, in this whole world

[Lil' Kim]
Just cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich, but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck..

You can get with Queen Bee.. (y'all can get with Queen Bee)

Ain't nuttin gon' change, my name, gon' get bigger
It's in the cards for Lil' Kim to get richer, and richer

Ended with someone inside an electric chair
And the same man that she was in love with's now in love with me

So you know he got my girlfriends cursin' me out
Sayin' that I'm whipped and he turnin' me out
No need for the gym 'cause he be workin' me out
For me, he got a huge appetite
Lick my ice cream like a tasty delight
The bond between us is tight
I heard Duve poppin' tonight but

[Hook]
I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight

[Verse 2]
Tonight it's just me and my boo
Candlelight dinner, sippin' some wine too
Lingerie see-through, you know how I do
Playin' slow jams to set the mood
Some Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, a little Anita
In the bed laughin' at Martin and Gina
All eyes on us like we Brad and Angelina
No one can come between us
The things he do give me the chills
Like writin' out ""I Love You"" in hundred dollar bills
He don't even think about playin' the field
He in ecstasy without takin' a pill
He treats me like a queen I love the way he courts me
Makin' love in the Ferrari he just bought me
Playin' play station, fight night
I heard Stereo poppin' tonight but

[Hook]
I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight

[Verse 3]
From the bed, to the kitchen, to the living room couch
We done blessed every room in this New York penthouse
Miami estate, house by the lake
We ain't watchin' pornos, we watchin' our own sex tape
I pour the Henny all over his jimmy
So when he stick it in me, he's drunk off of Kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster than a semi
'Cause Kimmy get the jimmy rock harder than a penny
Full body massage, champagne bubble bath
Then we make love on a bed made of cash
He can't get enough, he always ready to smash
He love how I'm shaped just like a hourglass
His niggas is tight, he chillin' with his wife
But they don't come before the love of his life
We in the crib havin' a pillow fight
I heard Lotus is poppin' tonight but

[Hook]
I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight

I gets right to the point (no time to play around)
When it comes to this cheddar (lay a nigga down)
Bust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine
At first I seem friendly but that's just in me
I warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin' like you
Y'all paper thin, my shit recycled
They call me Lil' Kim a.k.a. Cover Girl
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin' world
Niggas buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails
And aw, shit, I got it all in this bitch

[Chorus]
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash

We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash

To all my bitches in the strip club shakin' they ass
(I ain't mad, do your thing, mami) Get that cash
And all my hustlin' niggas still out on the ave
Fightin' over blocks and who got the best rocks
And goodness gracious, the struggle never stops
The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots
People fuck to my music, they say it's pornographic
My Billboards is nice, one day gon' be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with members only jackets
That sleep on brass beds with money for a mattress
Gettin'-money bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the picture of a dime
Cuttin' niggas short like inmates for phone time
Everything I get is custom made
Niggas wanna get laid, I gotta get paid (the papers)

Verse One: Kim
If I could make it rain
I'd make it rain diamonds
So all the girls in the world
Could keep shrinining
From princess cuts to emeralds to H-classes
Yeah, I failed math, but bet I passed the E-class
Went from Chanel number 5 to two point five
The Melrose resident, every rooms a president
With the live in waiters, betcha haters can't match that
You're six digits short to catch that
Your're net year gross it 20 thow on commission
My net week gross 100 mil in addition to to the Dow Jones
Stocks, restaurants out in Rome
Plus all the over head
And the interest on those loans

Chorus:
I want diamonds
(She said she wants a man- to buy her a Lexuz Land)
But that's all right for her
But still it ain't enough for me
I want diamonds
She said she wants a guy
To do it to her every night
That's all right for her
But you gotta go down on me

Verse Two: Kim
I had bitches rockin the red, yellow and green wigs
Cats in they raps tryin to act like Big
Remember when Big told y'all
Get Money
Remember when Big said play them niggas like dummies
Check it
If I could separate all the game from the glory
I'd rather be with Frank, but that's a different story
Cause now a days niggas ain't sayin shit (word)
Runnin off at the lips about what they gonna get
And what they had in '86
I puts them on the spot
Pull out the lab top
With the receipt for the yacht
What you got?
Niggas be mute all of a sudden
What, I pushed a button?
Shit, that ain't nothin'

Bridge:
I don't care if he's young or old
Just make him very rich
I just want someone that can spend dough
I want diamonds
Yes I do
And a house that's made of gold
There's only one thing better than money
Come into my bedroom honey

Verse Three: Kim
So we can have a drink or two
Cosmos, if you ghetto this Buds for you
Here's a few
So he can be nice
When I show him this ice
On my chest
That I bought with his American Express
I'm a mess, never-the-less
I'm authentic
Ninety-nine percent B-K
One percent N-J
Excuse me
Cause what I'm tryin to say
Is if you ain't thorogh
Stay out my borough
Cause when my gun burn, it's loud like Pairos
And when it's your turn, you fold like Gyros
And ya'll buy your suits in portions
I get mine's from an auction
Million dollar dress that belongs to the princess
While ya'll shopping at Saks
I been there, done that
Copt the sweater and the hat

Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets

Hen rock the shots of liquor, it makes me cum quicker
Rub between your belly like jelly
R. Kelly you think you ballin' but your body's callin'
Free fallin' and you roll in fuck the bumpin' and grindin'
Have you jumpin' and whinin' while I'm climbin'
I be doing groups like Troop
Body rockin' H-Town or Horace Brown
Watch out now
Babyface can pay the rent and cook me five meals
But momma got the whip appeal
What the deal on that Prince cat
He be lookin' fruity but you still can eat the booty
Brian McKnights tight Joe is kinda slow
Oh, what about D'Angelo
I want some of that brown sugar
Then watch this rap bitch bust all over ya nuts, like

Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)

[Verse 2]
I fuck Mista the flyway, fuck dem LaDae cats, they whack
And one on them resemble Craig Mack
I need a New Edition I need some Men of Vizion
Pussy eatin' position to go to shower pissin'
I made my Intro getting fucked in the Pinto
Now I'm skin deep in da Lexus Jeep
Peep da Queen sista if I would fuck wit Mista
They'd be lickin' blackberry molasses out my asses
Jason, who da fuck time ya wastin'?
I got no patience for little dick tastin'
I'd rather go dolo than solo so I can get some Heaven
And be the fuck out After 7
All for One and One for All
I swear to God I'd never fuck with none of y'all
And if you're immature then I'm out the door
I'm on fire gettin' head by the Harlem Boys Choir

Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick

Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick

[Verse 3]
I couldn't find a mall with Kenny Lattimore
Montell Jordan ain't scorin'
Tevin Campbell niggas like to shamble
Make him an example
With this pussy sample here we go
You didn't know Joe was my ho
Tony Rich my bitch don't fuck with this
I got the 112 nuts to bust so just
Open wide when I'm done give me a high five
You can touch me and tease me as if my name was Case
We got to drink a pace for me to participate
Don't playa nigga it's cool with me
I'm icin' Bryson that dude down with Groove Theory

Ladies and gents, your dopest host presents extravagance
In the lady frame
Leavin' cum stains, niggas remain in awe
When I brought a Derringer, throw it to ya jaw, uh
Never a flaw
Never before have you seen such magnificence in the black princess, yes
Flow's phenom, I'm the bomb-diggity, ask Biggie
Keep a dedicated squad with me, call us the Gabbana girls
We dangerous, bitches pay a fee just to hang with us
Trust, niggas lust
Without a bank account, I doubt we could swing that route
Feel me out, uh, I'm used ta’
Hangin’ with boosters, in the best name brand
With the insane clan
Man, listen
My position is lieutenant
Like a block of hash, got the burners up in it, percent it

To please me you got to be well off
Bust a shell off, with a tattoo that starts off

Bitches be lyin' bout the clothes they be buyin'
Some stores won't even let you whores in
'Til I begin to embarrass that ass and get crass
Kim surpass all crews
Bitches still drinkin' booze
I sip Cristal and Landcruise
Receive all the “ooohs” and the “ahhhs”, the jewels and the cars
Slick nigga, I'm stickin' you, Baby Pah, uh
Yes indeed, flows first class and yours is coach like the bag

Jog five miles a day, then I hit the sauna
My girls rock Chanel and smoke mad marijuana

Life without me, wake up you're having bad dreams
Cause ya’ fiend for a toke
My crew tote Tocques and mink coats
On the cell with the boat
What you thought?
We get caught and get bailed out?
Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessy on the rocks is all we got as we sail out
Entrepreneurs, Cristal pourers, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring, huh? I'm warnin' ya’
Style waits for no bitch, I dream rich
When I fuck with scratch and sniff
Now I stacks the shit, practice it
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous
So I can relax a bit, and get my toes licked

Pull up with my nigga in the eighty foot yacht

Cause from the gate I *brrrr-raaa* down the door
Like Eddie Murphy I gave it to you raw
Two-piece bikini, Fendi mink draggin' on the floor
Kim been the first lady since I dropped Hard Core
A lot of these hoes livin' vicariously through me
'Steada doin' them, they'd rather do me
Watchin' them is like a Broadway play
Sittin' next to the Queen
Is the closest they'll ever get to Brooklyn
Why ya'll frontin' you know who the best be
I'm the reason why the game so sexy
Tha originator, tha trend creator

The feds pinched me for shootin'
But instead they indicted me for my fuckin' music
This jealous muthafucker and this prosecutin' dyke bitch
Probly go home, listen to How Many Licks
Stay away from 5-0, that's that hiphop cop
These cheese eatin' rodents really got the game caught
You see when you on top, niggas want what you got
Even though they idolize you, they still critisize you

So don't preach to me bout singing , I, I am just a woman
You've got your feelings I got mine, I'm only human
And I gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I've gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I'm tryna go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I...gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on

Bottles in the air like luggage and jet cargos
We keep the champagne coming till the bar close
These S1 keep the don on chill, I just blew 50 like the shady deal
We faded, me and my peoples we wasted (yeah) the bar is open

Each one mill and this ring on my finger is an E one deal
Canary yellow stone, can't be faded
Fatigue belt, 45 made for the navy
Young niggas ready to grapple down ya buildin'
I'm living chilling, arms wrapped around a Brazilian
In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm

Hit her from the back, same time my mind blown
Speechless so she scream in silence
A real bad boy and all my speeches violent

I picked my best friend up and hit the nigga back
He pulled a ring out, couple chains out
I fucked his brains out, at his mane's house
Then went and gave the jewelry to my young niggas

Clothes too tight and my ass too sassy
I'm a love goddess haven't you heard?
Jehovah's my witness, spread the word
And all scrubs get kicked to the curb
Before you holla at me throw a few dollars at me
I see you got a brick in your pants
Would you like a table dance?
The boss lady make you pay for the sex
Then shake my ass like I'm at a Greekfest
No cash, I take Traveler's Checks
For an extra five g's you can have my address
The things I do I take a real risk
A lot of people think that I'm a real bitch
Don't judge me by the words of this song
Cause the media, they got me figured out wrong

I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about me

Got two hoes, Tonya and Tiffany
Finger in the drawers and we downin' Henessy

Now I'm gettin' head in the Q-45
That's LV, minors is six and up
With the big atennas that be sittin' up
I'm livin' it up, drink Cris, piss in the cup
With a bunch of birds that with it to fuck
I love life (no doubt)
So fuck a ho and a wife
Peace and love to all my sluts and my dikes
Cease never treat a bitch nice
I wanna bitch that smoke and don't get an appetite
I fuck to die cause my mom fucked for me
That's why my niggas never sling dick for free
Feel me?

I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about Cease
I have no love for hoes, my dick just ain't for free
I keep a lot of pussy on my mind
Some people think that I'm nasty
I just like fucking all the time

See some niggas do, and some niggas don't
Pay for the pussy, some niggas won't
See, I ain't the type that can say ""I Don't""

You can be Cash and I'll be Tango
Bingo, you know just how this thang go
Niggas wanna get with me without the ching-ching dough

And was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?
Ain't enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
And since Frank White taught me how to play the game
La Bella Mafia, nigga I play to reign
They put my album in the street like they pump the 'caine
I'm like bleach - Lil' Kim leave a permanent stain!
I'm feared in my country like Saddam Hussein
I might give a, little head to {""hold it, hold it now""}
All we ask is y'all show respect
Cause we don't want talk, big homey, just cut the check!
Now I'm sittin outside in my 6.6
Just signed a lil' deal bout 6.6
Used to transport bricks and make 6.6
If you look in my garage I got 6 joints

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
When we come to the clubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
Where my bitches and my thugs gettin right (hold it, hold it now)
Come chill in V.I.P. with us for the night
Whoa!
When we come to the clubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)

"[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Oh, how it hurts, like childbirth
The wounds heal slow, you just don't know
At times, I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray, day to day
But still, I feel my strength might die
Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
Damn, I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry B.I., I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas, caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration
But just when I'm about to quit, God tells me to just

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Frank White, the man with the money and the fame
Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me, I know exactly what you're going through

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better
I got your back

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
We miss you so much, I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy, but we fakin'
And to New York, thanks for the support
And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight
So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight, Frank White

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Don't you give up, be strong (be strong)
Hold on, hold on (you gotta hold on, girl)
Things are gonna get better (don't let 'em rule you)
Tough times, they last so long (you better stay sane)
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better
Don't you give up, be strong (see we need you, always need you Kim)
Hold on, hold on (every day, we miss you, we miss you BIG, oh)

You want to get freaky again, aight
A-ooh-ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

This verse goes out to my niggas in jail
Beatin' they dicks to the double-X-L magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!
Jailer, open up cell, block eight
Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggas do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

If you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

Million dollar deposit
Half a mil' in my closet
Phantom milky white chocolate
If the roof is on then I chop it
S1 on my finger
On the steering wheel of that Beemer
I just bought the new M6, while they customised my GINA
Kimmy pull up at your party, Maybachs and Ferraris
Ducatis and Harleys, pink seats in Bugattis
Don't nothin' move 'til I say so
We all about them pesos
I.R.S. nigga we the mob
We hustle hard, cocaine dough
That Mercedes topless, ain't that bitch exotic
My men just bought me that white rose and I ain't talkin' flowers

What you worried 'bout what I'm earning?
Money I keep burning

Uh, it's looking like I'm headed back behind bars again
Cause bitches wanna start with Kim and I ain't with the arguing
I'm jet chartering, fresh cardigan
Getting my Martha in while these broke hoes borrowing
I guess it's back to stashing guns in the bra again
Pulling bitches out they car again
These swagger jackers give the game a bad look
Pop shit on Twitter and apologize on Facebook
And now they wanna send me requests
Telling me that I'm simply the best
I won't stop till I see my enemies rest
They probably get locked up for identity theft
I ain't got time for bum bitches, the gun get it
I come with it, anything you tryna do, I done did it
I'll let you live for a while but I'm dying with the crown
The queen's back, bitches, come get it

Since you resist on running your jibbs off
After I drop these flowers for B.I.G. off
I'mma come and blow your lid off, like Adolf
Rolling up the tints, then peel off
Better wear your crosses and roseries, read the Qur'an
Pray to Allah for you think about approaching me
Uh, all I rock with is gutter niggas
Cut all affiliations with sucka niggas
I got bitches that'll gun-butt a nigga like Tameka and Tammy, uh
I gave birth to your style, watch how you speak to ya mammy
Your team can't fuck with my family
And I ain't talking Internal Revenue
I'm talking IRS, the Goodfella crew
Uh, you was never hard, check my repertoire
Fuck cash, my name is a black card

This was God's work but you couldn't see
God blessed you when he sent you to me
See your boys don't see a side that I see

Cause right now our love don't live here
First to reconcile, something gotta give here

Put a ring on it, drop a few kids here

Keep still in the shit, killin the rhyme
The Queen stay poppin the wine and cockin the nine
For those who think they stoppin my dough
Wanna copy my show, wha
I'm switchin my flow, can't take it no mo'
Oh you think I'm playin around
I'm layin ya down
Album drop, new millenium shuttin it down
Better off givin it up, I'm rippin it up
Spendin money, livin it up, not givin a fuck
Hiding the tote, runnin the coast
Makin niggas catch the Holy Ghost
I'm realer than most, wha
The trendsetter, the Brooklyn repper
You know the routine
Smoke you like a ciggarette-r
We've been, out in a bit
Y'all still talkin shit
Ain't that a bitch?
What part of the game was this?
Millions I'm holdin'
Drop tops rollin'
Diamonds on my neck
And Bentley ballin'
Me and my niggas gettin' high all day
Straight to the top, cuz we on our way
Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all
Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Back when it used to be the eighties
Said the world was gon' end in 2000 (that's crazy)
I'm the only thing to fear
For the new year
New year, and if BIG was here (woo)
Get the fans, we the ones to talk
We die real on the streets
So watch where you walk
And you can find me, usually
Talkin' dirty to a cat thugged out
Or even kinda nerdy
Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease and JM
Taking over like a plague on a town
All y'all can do is pray and watch it go down
Like when the ball drop
My fam's all I got, we keep it gangsta
Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all
Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

[Verse 3: Phil Collins]
Well, if you told me, you were drowning
I would not a lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
Saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Taxi Driver: Alright, sir, which side of the street would you like to be on?
Patron: Yeah, that one. That side right there.
Taxi Driver: Yeah, okay.

Taxi Driver: Okay, that will be four-ninety please.

The patron hands another bill over

Concession Stand Worker: Ah, man, why this shit so slimey?
Patron: Huh!

into the screen room. Lil' Kim and a man are heard moaning and having sex. Porno music is heard in the background
The patron unzips his zipper. A splashing noise is heard as the patron begins masturbating.*

Y'all just playin the greatest like Will Smith
I kill 'em with kindness, blow a lil kiss
Look like you gotta weak bladder, you a lil pissed
Uh, but it ain't my fault, the queen never left
I don't know what y'all thought
Right back to ballin'
Gettin' money is sport
And i always tell the truth even when I'm in court
New York, it ain't New York
Go on show off, drop the top on that Porsche
If everyday ya hustlin' like Rick Ross
Then you get it like a boss
No matter what it cost

Wishin' on a star but ya never get lucky
Me and Sha Money gotta rap like a mummy

You can't miss me at night, I glow in the dark
Look baby, I'm a rockstar, no guitar
Young, fly nigga shades on like Bret Hart
ShaMoney gets more than a lil dome
Quick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal
I don't need a super woman, I just need a lil more
Lil cris, lil haze, and a lil dro
And I'm cooler than an A/C breeze
Still stomp a nigga out in my ACGs
Still run up in ya crib through that ADT
ASAP where that money at
If I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'ma go and get that duffle bag
I ain't never ran from a nigga, I ain't a runnin' back

Dang nigga, you soak a nigga like a bubble bath

Ya'll know who it is
NEW MONEY!
It's me, bitches

[Verse 1]
Back up on the scene, it's the microphone fiend
Fuck keepin' it clean, I'm keepin' it real green
(WARNING) She's hazardous, ghetto-fabulous
You can't see her with binoculars (You cannot see her dawg)
I'm keepin' it Holly-hood, out in Hollywood
Put ya lighters up if you rollin' that backwood (put 'em up, put 'em up!)
Once again it's on, your girl's back in the zone
Maybe it's the beat or the seven shots of Patron
Like Cypress Hill, I'm 'Insane In The Brain'
My niggas, clear the lane, I'm comin' to bring the pain (she comin')
Time for a change, ya'll all sound the same
Ya'll all makin' it rain, we makin' it hurricane
Like a good meal, I hit the spot
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
What you cowards forgot, is stayin' on top
I'm kinda like your album, it ain't never gon' drop
Y'all got gun, and they never gon' pop
You already know the motto, ""Ain't Never Gon' Stop""
I'm always on that green light, tryna get my team right
Back to back 5-50s, that cream white
Red diamonds like a infrared beam light
My soldiers masked up like it's Halloween night
You know the apple-bottoms got the jeans fittin' tight
Marciano bra got the titties sittin' right
JT had a sexy track, but it's gon take Lil' Kim to bring sexy back
It's me the trendsetter, 24/7 Star sweater
24 karat gold on Astar leather, best thing since Donetella
We in the club and our table's bottled up like a wine cellar
Let's get this mozzarella, money is time fella
The Queen reign better get under my umbrella-ella-ella-aye-aye-aye
It's the Mafia La Bella-ella-ella, all day-aye, yeah
Kim still gutta mane
American Idol, before Ruben Studdard mane
My sex appeal make you stu-stu-stutter mane
My CD all in ya crib like brudda mane
I'm seasoned with all the right spices
I'm the whole pie, y'all just slices
I'm hotter than Tabasco sauce
When God make it rain. it's to cool me off

[Hook]
Get that money, get that money
Don't stop huggin' the block, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Don't stop huggin' the block, get that money

[Verse 2]
Cause I'm 'bout to own the charts
When I pop my collar, man I'm extra heavy on the starch
Extra heavy on the wheels, extra heavy on the watch
Jewelry like Henny, extra heavy on the rocks
My dudes on the grind, extra heavy on the block
You know I like my men extra heavy with the guap
You lookin' for the dude leavin' the club in the Gallardo
I'm lookin' for the due leavin' in the helicopter
So we can toast, overlooking the coast
Just think about that, next time you flyin' coach
Yeah I came home, little meat on the thighs
I'm eye candy, real sweet on the eyes
Yeah I fucked with Nas, hypnotized B.I
Damn, they even thought I married Jay, like Blige
But nah, nah, Kim keep two steppin'
Two-fo'-seven, is what I'm reppin'
Lil' Kim for mayor, fuck with a real bitch
Queen Bee nigga, get with the real shit

Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killin' her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, FaceTime
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron

And she hand 'em the tone

It’s Kimmie Blanco, female Keyser Söze
Take over the game, Hercules conquer
That bitch know how I get down, they already prompt her
So while you leave the screen, beam aiming, here’s your encore
We strapped in them V12s, no seat belts
So much money that the bills pay themselves
So much honey, killer bees in the shelves
Extra gunpowder, cocaine in the shells
Yea, y'all bitches kinda hot, meet hell
Scarface, in them Loub red heels
I swear I got them bitches running like a treadmill
Fictitious little bitches, but I make you dead real
And at the end, you won’t even have a friend to get
Made bitch, I got the keys from the syndicate
So fuck it if it ain't old, I like my money vintage
Walls got so much plaques I gotta call a dentist

I am Kimmie Blanco, Blanco
The motherfucking head honcho, honcho
So you better have your poncho, poncho
About to rain on you pronto, pronto

[Verse 2]
It’s Kimmie Blanco, get to know the name
I go off on tracks like derailed trains
I don't do the airports when I board my planes
You hustle all wrong, you only chase the fame
Plant a few seeds, that’s how I catch you birdbrains
La jarena of the game, like I'm from Medellin
I put hits out, long kiss goodnight ya
You’re all welcome to the problems, we invite ya
Let’s get it jumping, like a motherfucking tip-off
I come through and let a clip off
They like ""Oh, I think she pissed off""
Nah, it ain't nothing to a fucking boss
One head now you getting dust off

While niggas popping ya top, we popping the bottle

She want him home by one, he ain't showing tonight
I guess ol' girl ain't throwing it right
Down down baby on the first lady
Before he bust, I'm slidin off to Slim Shady
Dear Eminem, you just don't understand
I want to melt in your mouth and not in your hands!
Your accent make me horny, you got hits
So peep the remix: your bum is on my tits
Usher, you ain't got to call
Have you singing 'U Remind Me' to a blow up doll
I'm into sports, mostly basketball
I be like, ""Ohh"" when they take it to the hole
Picture me the coach of the New York Knicks
Getting head from Sprewell, choke on this!
Sixty-nine's the position I can't resist
I'm that blunt in Snoop's mouth, smoke on this
From Chris Webber to Vince Carter, who get in the best
Competing for the Queen like a dunking contest
Yo, J to A.I., when you in Bedstuy
Make sure you holla at the K.I

Why the fuck you ain't call me to be ya personal trainer
I'm just fucking with you, don't get mad, and try to spazz
Or I'll have to call that nigga Kostya Tszyu on your ass
Tyson, Sugar Shane, you boxers turn me on
Hope your dick's like your money be... real long
Just 'cuz I'm a freak and talk dirty in my songs
This pussy ain't for free, now that's where you're wrong
I take Tank to the bank, before his career sank
For me to sex him, I need about 17 drinks
Like The Artist said, I'm a sexy muthafucka
Tryna make a Rush Hour 3 porno with Chris Tucker

How they scream my name, how I pimp this game
Critically acclaimed, until my last day

Y'all better stand up or sit down, cause I'mma be here
Pull up a beach chair and pop you a Becks beer
I'mma live it up, 'til I'm a hundred with gray hair
Glass house in Bel-Air that's, high up in the mountain
Golden gates, and the brass water fountain
'Til my last day, I'm goin hard
And I ain't slowin up, 'til the Heliport's in my back yard
'Til my whole team sign they name on that black card
'Til I bring New York back, 'til I show you where I'm from
'Til I show you how it's done, show you why I'm number one
'Til my peeps is out the hood, 'til I buy my moms a jet
'Til I own my first island and cash a trillion dollar check

In negotiations with Bill Gates and his broker

Besides God, what the fuck should I fear?
The only one could stop me is that chick in the mirror
I built my career on, blood sweat and tears
And I'm still here, gettin stronger each year
Cause what don't kill me, could only help build me
I guess all that dirt just made me more filthy
If being loyal's a crime, then I'm so guilty
If you was missin a spine you'd still have to feel me
Some came and went but your girl is everlasting
'Til the day I'm gasping (gasping)
And niggas droppin tears on my Versace casket
And I'm, reunited with Big, like nigga what happened?
Shit got drastic, I missed you with a passion
By now they should realize I'm not the average rap chick
Ain't nuttin they could do now to stop my shine
This is God's plan homey, it ain't mine

And the last breath leaves my lung, I'll be

Check your stats, I'm all that, bottom line
It's all there in black and white, read it and weep
I'm the, perfect example of keepin it street
Cause when it's all said and done and at the end of the day
My actions spoke louder than whatever they say
Yeah I'll rep the hood, stood the test of time
So a cell'll hold my body and never my mind
So, never mind any of y'all petty tactics

I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Feds get clap too
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind 'cause we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's all about that dollar

By the lion in the concrete jungle

The weak fold and crumble

Show you what to do and you don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you

The life of a gambler

Roll up and just bumrush shit

Your honor, Lil' Kim is a threat to society
She has shown a blatant disregard for the law
And has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty
For the vicious acts, she should be punished to the fullest extent of the law

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Pardon me your honor, may I address the bench?
They tryna assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt
Excuse my persona
I may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer
Ever since I killed 'em, I ain't been in trouble since
It wasn't my fault, I acted out of self-defense
He killed my best friend (Who's him?) I mean them
They was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too
They had real grenade bombs inside of their palms
And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom
(Stop!) I heard three guns cocked, that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top
(Oh, she's lying!) Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor
Fingerprints all on the door, need I say more?
Pulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow, ploom!
Queen off her toes, they fell down like dominoes
I think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix
What was I to do? Sit back and just take this?
Yo, I'm tellin' you now If I lose this debate

Excuse my client's temperament
Who has had social intelligence?
With so much innocence we have to implement
She was slightly out of place
But if you grant us a grain of your grace
I'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case
Imagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes
The same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose
Your children, your lovely wife, I mean look at her
The only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter

Order in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts
And the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort
The men dressed in blue, they were undercover cops
Hungry to see another black motherfucker shot
They ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders

(He was in on it too!)
Yeah
(I guess I should've known)
Yeah
(Objection your honor)
Yo objection overruled
I know the news they tried to pay the grand jury
To give you life sentence with parole up in thirty
Now that's dirty, surveillance and you debate
Fuck Will! Now you're the new Enemy of the State
Angela Bobbett's cake compared to you
And Junior Mafia, that clique ain't scared to move
So they took precautions
Grenades from all force and
Professional marksman with four fours of war hymn
But you stopped, dropped, rolled and duck
Shot back other bitches would've folded up
Now that's my kind of bitch
I know I'm the judge
But I love that bitch
And I'm coming with her
Creme of crop, and me, I'ma hold her down

And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic
I got the magic stick

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke

[Chorus 2: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic, uh-huh uh-huh
I got the magic clit

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim not a whore
But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to sex don't test my skills
Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
.. and I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the ""Drugs"", baby, I'm makin ya high!

[Chorus 3: 50 Cent & (Lil' Kim)]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I am the baddest chick)

(And I'll show you magic - what? What?)
Magic (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim & (50 Cent)]
Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tasting it
(Sex ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (One minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
Have that ass trickin' after one back shot
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the CL drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight

And that's that
It may sound rude
But I don't love you dudes
Tape you eatin' my pussy and throw you on the interlude (scene)
You think I give a fuck cause you paid for my food?
Put you out on the highway and make you strip nude, (hehe)
Then drive away in your car with your wallet
Thought I was sweet meat
Look what you done started [run dat]
You ain't know about the,""set it off queen bitch""
In the Porsche, license plate read,""filthy rich""
I spend money
Lend money
I play niggas with money
Matter fact I love money
And I never borrow
Even if the ones low
Cause if it cost ten, I give 'em 20 so I never owe (scene)

Funny style cats bump us while we dance
You know a broke nigga always fucks up the plans
DJ switch the music to the Wu-tang clan
D-Rock hit himm in the face with the Saint Ives can
Security came through, broke it up, then he ran
Be back at the bar again
Laughin' and partyin'
Jerks showin off pullin 50s out they clothes (for real)
Please babe, bro we blow our nose with those ((you kno) dun kno)
Linen crushed out
Egyptian mushed out
Some boy lookin' shot in the party rushed out
My niggas, they surround me like the pope
You should've seen the shit, one big joke

My song spun in heavy rotation
Some wan' play Queen Bee like she dumb

Now my attitude's turned cold
Girls sell they soul just to have my flow
Like Keyshia Cole they just need to let it go
The game to be sold and not to be told
Wisdom I hold 'til the youth gets old
To the hopeless now I'm on Hope Road
Dudes floss cash and they know they in debt
Never play the ho, Queen Bee be the pimp
Can't slick talk I done heard that shit
Can't lie to a liar I reverse that shit
I run the club called the Players Residence
I'm not only a client, I'm the president
Did the crime, now the time you can't handle it
But ima play it out to it's full out extent
I came from the Stuy project tenement
Style wild like a child off punishment
About me everyone got opinions

Do anything for the fam, I'mma go along with the plan
Tryin hard not to throw him off
And I know he soft, when I cough, it's to cover up a lie
And the lie keep me full of empathy
So when I shit on this nigga, he gon' still pamper me

It's my nigga Blake C

Check it, let me school you
Remember when I said those niggas robbed Leo
Rolled on him, stuck him up in the black Geo
They was creole, used to be a tight trio
Til one fled with the dough, what's his name? (Rio!)
I was a girlie lover, smooth undercover
Played they hoes in tight clothes like they was no other
Dumbin like the Jungle Brothers, til they caught me for my gems

You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see the angels flying
Oh, I see you shining right through my window",Lil’ Kim,
"[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Who the flyest bitch in the game? (Lil' Kim)
Who be the baddest bitch alive? (Lil' Kim)
Who the sexiest chick around? (Lil' Kim)
What gangsta bitch, who ain't gon' ride? (Lil' Kim)
This for my pimps and my hoes
When they's in the Maybach, Bentley or the Rolls
I asked my nigga Nate Dogg
Outta all the ladies, why he chose the Queen Bee
And this is what he said y'all:

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I need me a bitch, with some big old thighs
I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch, with some pretty ass eyes
I need me a bitch, like I need some hash
I need me a bitch, so I can floss that ho, and make my ex mad
I need me a bitch, ain't no need to lie
I need me a bitch, so when I do some dirt, she be my alibi
I need me a bitch, like a need a 6-4
I need me a bitch, that'll shine my rims up and open my door
I need me a bitch, who is all of that
Cos I'm a fly ass motherfucking nigga who was born to mac
I need me a bitch, like never before
I need me a bitch, and I couldn't care less if the bitches yawn
I need me a bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
All eyes on the Queen, when I'm walking past
I'm in the Fendi mini-skirt, shakin' my ass
In slow motion for ya, slow motion for ya
I'm working that back daddy, how you like that daddy
Honeygirl Lil' Kim with the mac Nate Dogg
Reppin 3-1-0 to the 7-1-8 y'all
That'll have a Queen on your arm if you could
Take them wings off the Bentley, and put me of the hood
Oh, I'm what niggas want, I got what niggas need
I keep my coochi in Gucci, and you best belive
Get it on anywhere, no matter I'm looking
Sophisticated, I'm sexual so

[Pre-Hook: Lil' Kim]
I need me a trick, that's filty rich
I need me a fine ass motherfucking nigga with a big ass --
Cus I'm that (bitch)

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I--- I need me a bitch
I--- I need me a bitch, who ain't hard to please
I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch with some start up knees
I need me a bitch, who ain't scared to flirt
I need me a bitch, in the middle of the grocery store, so lift up her skirt
I need me a bitch, like I need my crew
I need me a bitch, a bitch, to pass on to my boys soon as I get through
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)
I need me a bitch, I love when she wildin' out, cos she still look fine
I need me a bitch, and a Coupe de Ville
I need me a bitch, a car with a big back seat, so I can make her squeal
I need me a bitch, like a need a drnk
Who can hold her breath real good, it's either swim or sink
Bitch
I--- need a bitch
I--- need a bitch
I--- need a bitch",Lil’ Kim,Nate Dogg

[Lil' Kim]
This is it, this is the one
(That's what I'm talkin' about right here)
Yo Puff I don't think they ready for this one
(They ain't ready baby)
You ready? (No doubt)
Yeah me too (Let's do it)

If gettin' money is a crime then I confess
It ain't about money I could care less
I used to be a B now I'm a C breast
I get em hard you handle the rest
My music like heartburn burn your chest
Like a nigga stick the axe inside your backs
You be like ""What the fuck was that shit!""
Gimme some more I love my fans
Gotta make em dance
Would I ever make a whack joint
Not a chance
Show my male friends call me M&M's
Cuz my pussy melt in your mouth and not in your hands
Just a bad girl always rockin' dimes
With the see-who's-stockin' skaters with the Lizzy's
Purpose with the deadbeats
Usually spited by my Goldilocks
While first movin' flocks I'm movin' drops
Cop the Ferrari when I'm roomin' the range
Two of the same it ain't a thang pocket the change
Now I'm just doin' my thing enjoyin' the fame
Why not ain't no other bitches hot in the game

Nobody do it better than us
Nobody do it better than us
Nobody do it better than us
Nobody do it better than us
Nobody do it better than us
Nobody do it better than us

Lil' Kim yeah everybody knows me
In a class by myself never where the ho's be
I just avoid where all my foes be
Cuz God damn muthafuckas is nosey
Wanna know what I'm wearing
What I'm drivin what I'm doin'
Where I hang out at who the fuck I'm screwin'
Damn I move way out to the boondocks
So I can have a little bit of privacy
You bought a tiny ass condo
Way across the water with a telescope
So you can spy on me
You clowns belong in the circus
Steady tryin' to hurt us
Tell me what's the purpose
They say I'm prejudice
The only presidents that I fuck with
Is the ones that's dead
Like the big heads
Never stingy with my Benji's
Got enough dough to buy the West Indies
Invest in Fendi's own Laurendi's
Start my own doll like Mark & Mindy's
Free all my niggas from the penitentiary
Yea keep puttin' out records till the turn of the century

Repeat 1

You got a 5 and I got a 6
Back it up
What's wrong with this picture nigga
Pack it up
I need a 6 figga nigga (uh huh)
Yours is big but mines is bigga
Cuz the Benji's is what it's all about
Do my ladies know what I'm talkin' about
If my shoes cost more than your car
Ha don't expect to get far
You the kinda nigga that like to plot
Call your friends tell em that you hit the jackpot
I keep razors in my bras
For all you womanizers
That's how much I despise it's up
I don't get it I ain't wit it
Can't see how other woman did it
Niggas screamin' gimme
Can't get a penny
Yea I got plenty
But you ain't got any?
Now picture me takin' my  hard earned money
Throwin' it away by spendin' it on a dummy
All he gon' do is spend it on another honey
I say let the nigga stay bummy
I don't need a nigga I jerks it out
Take it old school and smurf it out
Give me a B and I'll merk it out
Niggas know QB gon' work it out

Repeat 1

Nobody
As we proceed to give you what you need
In 2000 baby
And we rock on and on
All hail the Queen
All hail the King

Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it
Then I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh
Depending on how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites never gettin' into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes

I'm just trying to be me, doing what I got to do
So why y'all keep hating on me and my crew?
Yo, I'm saying Q.B, look at them and look at you
True, if I was you I'd hate me too
Louis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze
Every other week a different dude and other crews
I make offers nobody can refuse
You might even see me on the channel nine news
I get paid just for laying in the shade
To take pictures with a glass of lemonade
My rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade
(Uh-uh, Kim been fly since she was in the fifth grade)
Wake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid
Wanted me so bad you ain't copped or bootleg
Y'all niggas played like a high top fade
Some of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played
Y'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it
I rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it
My fam deep with security in the jeep
When the Queen come in town everything shut down

To the hip hip-hop a ya don't stop
To rock it to the bang-bang boogie
To up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat
Now what you hear is not a fake
It's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)
Now I know y'all heard other females rap
But they ain't got nothin' on me
'Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best
A hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)
So to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind
In fact I'ma give it to y'all one more time like..

Uhh! Say my name baby (okay)
Before you nut, I'ma dribble down your butt cheeks
Make you wiggle, then giggle just a little

What? Uh!
Here's another one
(Uh-huh)
Uh! Uh!

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Live from NYC, it's Q.B
The heavyweight champ, female MC
Girls say they different but uh see
In all actuality, they wanna be me
This chick running around with this stink ass gap
And them fake ass raps having panic attacks
You ain't a star
And your record company know that
How you make all this money, get this far and blow it
I'm a businesswoman now so I'm not concerned
I'd bet on Lil' Cease before you and your Firm
If this was back in the days I would've been snatched you
I'm getting money now
Them bitches in the hood they can have you
Stop paying these niggas to write y'all shit
For the right cream I'd write a hot sixteen
Better be careful what you say to me
That same shit you shit
I'ma make you sniff

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It's the N-O-T-O-R-I-O
U-S, you just lay down slow
It's the N-O-T-O-R-I-O

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Everybody wanna Shyne off of BIG
Get it, Shyne tryna sound like him when they rhyme
You ain't a murderer
Nigga, please come off that
I'm next up to bat motherfuckers get their jaws tapped
Bum ass nigga don't even know how to bust a gun ass nigga
You dumb ass nigga
Rappers acting out the late Frank White's path
Once they get in jail they get fucked in the ass
Never snitch, never send a nigga to jail
I'd rather find him by a boat doing the deadman's float
We gangsters
Real gangsters b
Gun in the green room up at BET
We gangsters
Real gangsters nigga
Kill you and cut the head off your babysitter
We gangsters
We gangsters bitch
Even more dangerous now we're filthy rich

Uh, uh, uh
The moral of the story is this
You ain't queen bitch
And you ain't BIG dick
Now I'm pissed niggas on some ""10% Dis""
Well shit I'ma break it down like this
Lot of rappers in this game
That's cool but uh
Only one of us could rule
You see its sort of like being in school
I'm valedictorian y'all in the audience
And I've got nine hundred and ninety-nine votes
You got nine hundred and ninety-nine nopes
You local bitch I'm worldwide
Can't you see? Open your eyes
I got you by a landslide
Y'all mad cause niggas love my style
Colgate smile, I'm a bad bitch child
Cats be frontin' like they one tough cookie

"[Verse 1]
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, ""rockin' the mic""
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

[Verse 2]
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin'""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
""I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,"" screamin'

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

[Verse 3]
The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight",Lil’ Kim,

Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em
I just shitted on 'em

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
All these bitches is my pets
I keep a tight leash around their necks
Bitches try to bite take their ass to the vet
Put 'em right to sleep like they popped a Xanax
Uh, yeah, I be shittin' on 'em
Spittin on 'em
Kimmy go in, I go extra hard
I swipe your whole life with my debit card

The Lamborghini turns into Megatron
Got 'em blue in the face, A-a-avatar
I be shittin on 'em, diarrhoea
You bitches lookin' burnt, gonorrhoea
Same bitches throwin' shots, but tryna be her
I guess it's all politics, Condoleezza
I'm the first lady, Her Majesty
Raps royalty, bitch now you work for me

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em

Yeah, I just did it on 'em

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
All you clones had your shine like cubic stones
Now the show's over, Jenny Jones
Toss 'em in the lake like Ricky bitch
And I stay on this money, like a pyramid
Yeah, I've been about a cheque, hoe
You stole your whole swag, you worse than a klepto'
I just blow 'em kisses, X 'n' O
Got 'em sick to their stomach, P-p-pepto
All you bitches is some bums
I feel your cup up with change
You hoes should be rappin' on the number four train
The price of your mother's house, I paid for my Range
Uh, and that's a autobiography
I swear these hoes be obsessed how they copy me
Laxative flow, I'm shittin' on 'em constanly
And I leave a stain like I ain't wiped my ass properly

Who ever thought that I would grow and to be rich?
All these niggas tried to hit me, but these niggas missed (Huh)
My brothers with your bomb, please send 'em my salam (Lord)
That brand new SEL across my mother's lawn (Ah)
I swear I come in peace, but my lil homies aren't
Hear them gunshots that go from Brooklyn down here to Bronx (Bang)
Bulletproof the Bimmer, now I'm battle ready (Boss)
Me and Kimmy 'til I die, forever adversaries (Woo)
I'm talkin' money, pussy nigga, Tyler Perry (Woo)
Goin' back to Cali so I'm riding ready (Huh)

Coogi sweaters, Jesus pieces, gotta do it big (Uh)
Fab said you need a Kim if you gon' do it big
Niggas want the smoke, I hop out with the cig
I'll wack a nigga, then buy a flight to Madrid
I did the bid, now I do the most
Whole team burnin' bread, let's make a toast
I ain't the type to brag, I let that paper boast
Then I wash the dirty money in that ivory coast
Rich milli', half a million
My shit slap silly, yeah
Quarter milli' this year on shoes
Give a broke bitch the blues
Ran off with a couple mil' in high heel, Jimmy Choos
I'm a bad bitch from every angle
Jesús hang around your neck like the noose
May the Bishop pray for you 'cause you know I got the juice
We bet it big at the crap table, seven eleven
Open like we 7/11, workin' all night, 24/7
Fuck the FBI, I only confess to the reverend
Put that on my bredrin
Let this be a lesson when you disrespect the legend

Ride the beat like a Wraith

That you hear that pussy talkin' at night?
C'mere, lingerie drive you crazy when she put it on
Safe sex but sometimes I hate to put it on
Make me moan, grab my back and pull me deeper in
She catch 3, I catch 2, now I'm sleepin' in
Miss Virginia take her time when she hit that head
She pull her long hair back and sit between my legs
It blow your mind when you got a dime
Who rub your nuts when you fuck her from behind
I ain't lyin' somethin' special 'bout her
Got me sneakin' out the house like a fuckin' mouse
And that pussy's so wet for me, she my ecstasy
Crazy, pussy damn near better than your old lady
I probably need to stop answerin' the phone
Fuckin' her I'll fuck around and have my family gone

My strawberry haze, he wanna smoke it
And she turn into a tiger if you provoke it
Watered down pussy, super soak it
I leave him solid as a rock, turn his dick to stone
You know that kind of pussy that break up happy homes
Like a cockatoo, I ate up all his bread
Addicted to my top, he call it crack head
I love his doggystyle, I call him Snoopy
His friends say he fiend out, they call him Pookie

I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive

Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch! Uhh
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit

Men see the vide-oh, and go lick the TV slow
I show 'em things, they never seen before
Cause the way I move, is so flexible
I'll try anything, Imma try sexual
The blindfolds and handcuffs, a bit rough
When my thighs wrap around his head, like earmuffs
Doin' freaky weird stuff, talk tough, face down
And step into the Queen with the diamond laced crown
The Jewel of the Nile, I'm romancing the stone
I said ""look bitch I got your man on the phone""
But you can swing through, if you want a peep show
Just bring a hun'ed grand and some Veuve Clicquot

In Iceberg jeans, that ass looks mighty nice
And this is the fabulous life of Kim Jones
I got chinchilla covers on my flip phones
To match with them furs, baby got back with them curves
A female matte, with makeup on my words
Flow, mascara and blush
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us

Go on work it on down, too my thighs and legs
Put your face in it, no bitch can see me

Not the sticky ones that taste like slaw

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
No fake shit, permanent realness
The minute that you feel this, it's terminal illness
Incurable, they ain't able to heal this
All I ever try to do is give you the real 'Kiss (Muah!)
Let it off then we fleeing the scene
They ain't see us but they heard that it was me and the Queen
I got this Tom Ford shit on, and she in McQueen
Think I'm going colorblind, all I see is the green
Ain't worth counting if it ain't done properly
House on the mountain, V12's on the property
Cup full of drink, big Dutch full of broccoli
Cancer on the track, even Dre can't doctor me
No penicillin, no antibiotic
Just the Purple Haze, lil' something exotic
Booth or the barrel, quicker to the cabbage
Al-Qaeda Jada, sicker than your average

[Hook: Jadakiss & The Notorious B.I.G.]
And you know I'm (Real sick)
Chain got 'em (Real sick)

"[Intro: Lil' Kim]
S-W nine millimeter, check
Long-nose double barreled rifle, check
Semi-automatic infrared laser beam shot, check
Alright Puff, I'm ready to go

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Threw the clips around the shoulders
Toasters in the holster
(Kim, let's go!) Slow down bab' bro
You with the rap Rambo, Tony Montana
Here's a hammer, a camera, and a ""Life After Death"" bandana
Here take it, in case I don't make it
'Cause if my life don't end, I'm damn sure gon' fake it
The way I see it, mmm, sexual
In the gunfight, two on three, you on me
Dawg, I got shit to make the world shake
One mistake, blaow, start a earthquake
Fuck them niggas, them niggas dust to me
And if I knock Cyrus off, that's a plus for me
And the funny thing about it, I'm a bitch
And got niggas runnin' from me like the Olympics
And I'm told my man, Gutter, I'ma get him
And every shell I spit is guaranteed to hit him (blaka!)

[Chorus: Grace Jones]
Pressure down below
Fire in the hole
Lose control
Got nowhere to go

[Verse 2: Lil' Cease & Lil' Kim]
I heard Cease and Puff callin' like the Holy Tabernacle
I'll be down in a minute, I'm drinkin' a Snapple
A Snapple? Bitch, I got bombs and shit
Grenades and razor blades and alarms and shit
You better come on, girl, throw a hat on that weave
I'm tryin' to catch this nigga Cyrus 'fore him and his boys leave
They at this restaurant that serve African food
Where you allowed to smoke weed and the waiters is type rude
You see, I used to date this bitch from Botswana
Half-African, but she looked like Madonna
Ayo, check it, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the restaurant is where we met
And her girlfriend Lizette, that bitch is a freak
I used to fuck her in the ass while my girl was asleep
And she the one who told me where these cats is at
I can't wait to get the gat and holla back
(Kim, c'mon!)

[Chorus: Grace Jones]
Pressure down below
Fire in the hole
Lose control
Got nowhere to go

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
We came to a red light, gave right-of-way to pedestrians
Two black and white lesbians (hey hey, baby)
The nigga Puff ready to holla at these bitches
(Hey baby, let me holla at you for a second)
I'm like, ""Yo dawg, them bitches down with them niggas""
And never would the drugs make the bitch slack up
I got hit men, spreaded through the restaurant for backup
And we communicate through headsets and walkie-talkies
Them niggas just bitches like my Yorkie
Pigs like the Porky, we on point like snipers
Cyrus and his Doolies is Clueless like the movies
All I can think about is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, massacre style
Yeah, Cyrus did it, Cyrus the Virus they call him
When I finish with him please, his name is Swiss Cheese
My main focus is his righthand man Mouse
Sheisty and two-sided, profession dick rider
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin' me sick
And when Cyrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin' niggas up like a vacuum
Bullets flyin' nonstop and bodies droppin'
Puff yelled, ""Away!"" That's the cops then
My trigger finger started itchin'
Then Cyrus came spittin' from the kitchen
And next second you missed it
Listen, it's soundin' like the 4th of July
Like the solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes is in his body the size of cup holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff, I'm empty
(Here, I only got one shot left!)
But I'ma hold my breath 'til he fall to his death
But he was Elvis 'cause Little Kim squeezed off in his pelvis

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim & (Mario Winans)]
I was sitting at the bar
When this real horny guy came over
(Hi how are you doing? How are you?)
He said won't you let me take you
On a ride in my Range Rover
I said you can't be serious
My Bentley's right outside
Plus your breath smells like shit anyway

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Oh, I need you, oh
Gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah

Everybody's on the dance floor
And this fool is still behind me
I am dipping through the crowd now
Hoping that he doesn't find me
He said, baby, where you going?
(Lil' Kim I love you)
Then he grabbed me by the hand
And dipped my body to the ground
And said

Watch me shake my butt, butt-butt

I know you wanna see my thong

I rock on with my bad self cuz it's a must
Kim blow past hoes tell 'em 'Eat my dust'
Cuz um, I gets busy with my bad ass
Straight from Brook-lawn, Vietnam, Baghdad
Cuz I'mma get you high like that stick-icky one time
One verse from the Queen is like sniffin' a line
Higher than a fever, ya best believe her
This young viva senorita flow tighter than a two-seater
Lyrical murderer, I'm servin' these haters like a waitress
Back to the basics
I got the game in a chokehold, better take a No-Doze
Sleepin' on Kim is a no-no (UGH)
The capital Q-B, now take it to the E-E
I'm bringin' things to light but you still can't see me
I flows like the monthly you can't cramp my style
Can't take the pain here's a Motrin child
You already know it's Ms. G.O.A.T
Numero U-N-O, now here we go

I rock ruff n stuff though they put me in cuffs
But still I

I rock ruff though these punk niggas talk too much
But still I

Think ya hotter than me? YALL STUPID
Ain't no doubt about it I'm the UNDISPUTED

My verse crazy I write with stray jackets
You can't hack it, some try to backstab
I drive by them haters while they try to flag cabs
Hate to brag but fuck it why shouldn't I
'Gini with the top off, why wouldn't I
I was tought by the streets so how couldn't I
See right pass niggas like BIG's crooked eye
BOOM! BAM! GOT DAYYMMM!
I'm hittin' so hard I be shakin' the land
KIM GET IT CRUNK
Like the speakers in ya trunk, got you feelin' drunk
Off the rhythm that I give 'em
Spit that venom, in 'em, honey girl be killin 'em
Yea, I put that on my unborn kids

Does she do it like me?
Does she work that body?

Do she handle it like she got a deep throat?
I mean suck that cock 'til she start to choke
Does she like to have sex high off the X?
Try it with me and tell me who's the best
Does she like to wear thongs that you can eat?
Do she fuck your brains out 'til you fall asleep?

Bet you she don't fuck you
Like you know I fuck you
And I bet you she will never do, oh
All the things I'll do for you

Is she drop-dead fine?
Does she like it from behind?
Is she fly?
Do she got a style like mine?
Does she slurp it, rub it, jerk it, ride it?
Tell you how you feel when you inside it
You love me, and I know she know
'Cause every time I come around, she be like ""let's go""
Girls know not to leave they man around me
I get my hands on 'em
He putting wedding bands on 'em

Did she tell you that?
The bitch is a liar
People spend doe to see me spit fire
And niggas give they life to be with me for one night
I let you come in me, while you stick it in the booty
Lick the nut off, then stick it back in the coot, see
I bet you she don't even know how to kiss
And I bet you ain't never been fucked like this

Damn can't a bitch breathe, gimmie room please
I'm in the paper e'ry day if I piss or sneeze
I used to ride in a rental Lebaron
Now you can catch me in the SLR Mercedes McLaren (Hey Kim what up)
Gotta put the doors up, haters pick ya jaws up
I'm in the Trump International, 30 floors up (so high)
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'

You say you got this but we don't see nothin'

They got some nerve when the ones who do the ratings look a mess
Star Jones don't like me, she cheap and I like the best

But she's back bitches

Stop focusing on her and think about you for a second
Now ain't that depressing, ain't it depressin'
See, that's why don't nobody talk about you

Man, FUCK the law the whole system's corrupt
A street grudge put me in front of a judge
But I stood there like what, the Bee don't budge
It's a foul game, no such thing as fair play
And real niggas get railroaded everyday
Words misconstrued and used against you
Then you get screwed when it's time to sentence you

Meanwhile the media promotin the gossip
I had to say it, cause I'm that real with it
You shinin like a star, then you gotta deal with it
And dudes pick to take these groupies to bed
Better watch it 'fore they write a book about like Superhead
Fuck 'em and leave 'em then they after your paper
Put a hole in the condom and say that you raped her
See you can be a rapper, athlete or an actor
Believe me, these devils find a way to get at'cha
All it takes is some green and your face on the screen
Fuck it, just say I took one for the team

And watch for the snakes and the Jakes approachin

The ones you smoke wit, and sold your coke wit

And have your brains on the dashboard of the Range
Too often, I seen a nigga layin in the coffin
All cause some shit was blown out of proportion
Everywhere you go you gotta move with caution
Cause the rap game ain't much different than the crack game
It's the new hustle, gotta have brains and muscle
Get too much money and these haters wanna touch you
Now I can see why they all on me

And your B.M. trip when she see me in the club
Your man, five-oh, I don't see him in the club
Cause he out in the CT with a dick in his butt
Y'all stay OT while I stay O.C
That's, out the country with the A-R-A-B's
With my girl M to the O to the E
She ride like a soldier, that's my co-D
I'm ""Bella"" to that death and, don't ask why
Cause the ""Mafia"" is P-U-S-S-Y
And I'm more nigga than them bitch-ass guys
Cause they took the stand, on the D.A.'s side

And the girl stay fly - yo what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
It's the Q-U-double-E-N B-double-E
Hoes wanna be me - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?

I'm in the Lamb' or the Ferrari when I'm M.I.A
Take the Spyder down the strip, when I'm in V-A
The game slow, gotta put a little work in D.C
I ball like I'm WNBA's M.V.P
On, ESPN or, NBC
I like it raw like my boy the late O.D.B
Stop pullin out them burners on them DVD's
You gotta body a motherfucker to, impress me
My boys keep the M-A-C in the SUV
And they air somethin out on the, A-V-E
I'm in the B-E-N-Z doin a buck-oh-three
Tearin the clutch down on the B-Q-E

"[Intro: Big Troy, Lil' Kim]
Mmm baby, I missed ya
I missed you, too
I waited a long time for this
So why you ain't come see me, no commissary or nothin'?
I ain't wanna see my bird in no cage
But I'm ready to take care of you now
Now, after three years?
Three motherfuckin' years, nigga? You know what?

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Hasta la vista, bye-bye, kiss your kids
It's the gangstresses
What you think this is, nigga?
Calm yourself, it's just a little robbery
You got stricken with the poverty, starvin' me
Call me Sunshine, pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous, miraculous
I practice this for a livin', like the Buddhism
Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina, love ain't got shit to do, with me and you
Or the .44 under the pillow with the dildo
I like to play while I'm workin'
And that's for certain
Keep jerkin', I ain't done with you
Lights, cameras, curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this
Oh, they wouldn't believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis

[Chorus: Fela]
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me

It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
I heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
Out on me by your man Big D
Stink Gucara, I bought his life for 3 G's
Then some watches, then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad, they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin' goin' on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Mark's car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin' in they Morays, sippin' Dom P's and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from po-lice we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya, I cried for ya
You know this down-ass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you, but now forget you
I'd rather dead you, and wet you like I never met you

[Chorus: Fela]
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too

It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe

If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
And I remember, how you said you loved me
With a passion
High fashion
Who you askin'?
To keep the tum numb, from index to thumb
Push the V's with the coke from the DT's
Dope take the titties from city to city
I ain't see a G off none of them ki's
At ease, when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didn't snitch, you'd make a shorty rich, bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin' on the Peter Pan & Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin'
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didn`t appeal no more
Gats I couldn't feel no more
And now I'm the shit
Go by the name of Lil' Kim, the Queen Bitch
And M.A.F.I.A.'s the clique
Instead of playin' Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It don't pay to be nice, but it's nice to pay
And if you die before you wake, may your soul God take

[Chorus: Fela]
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me

No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got him in a zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?

With no strings attached, yeah nigga, picture that
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt

Like niggas be doin' yeah baby, I love you long time
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this

I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said 'Whoa! Who's the other guy?'
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth 'Fool, Give me my money!'
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars

Sometimes I look at my son
Then I picture my father
When he looked at his son
He understood his story
I can stand on the strip
Flip ten million zips
Or I can parlay with puff
And make a 10 million flip
I been a boss and you know it
Make a mill and I blow it
I had a dream I would sell
And in July it was snowin'
Went and caught me a bird
Momma, pray for my blessings
Niggas fuck with my nerves
Talking fast with them questions
First spray was the ball
Worse fear was the verdict
Fill that mill and desert it
But the block was deserted
Talkin' 500 murders
About 100 I knew
I'm talkin' 500 cases
About 400 that blew
You lost it all in a day
But you been grindin' the longest
I mean you bought off the bar
But got no money for lawyer

Catch a body, get a face lift, disappear like Pablo

Well let's dance, you lames are finished
I serve all ya'll cowards like a game of tennis
Act like you want some of this and I'll give you the business
You see the yellow and black, you know what it's about
Wrinkled assed niggas gets ironed, to straighten you out
I got thugs in the east, thugs in the south
That'll stick you with an aids needle and piss in your mouth
I kept 'em on a leash and now it's time to let 'em out
Better pray to Jehovah, the game is over
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever underestimate
Lil' Kim the postergirl at 718
Ride outta town with my nigga, holdin' his weight
After it's cooked, chopped in eights the size of plates
You bitches ain't been through shit, you just minors
What you know about stuffin' half a bricks in your vagina
It's the dick licker, it's the baby sipper
Ain't a bitch alive can make a nigga cum quicker
Baby girl's pussy get wetter than a shower cap
Got my mans back like a Jansport napsack
And Queen Bee gon' bring you nothin' but heat
Homicide is lookin' for me for killin' these beats
You in the wrong department, this the upperclass section
You hoes is startin' to irritate me like a yeast infection
Good heavens, somebody get the Monostat 7
And hit me why don'tcha, hit me why don'tcha
The boss lady, I hold it down for my badies
Rappers better run and hide cause here comes the Beehive

[Verse 2: Reeks]
It's your boy, Money Cash, I get love in the streets
Breathin' dro colored Benz's with dutch colored seats
Lay in the crib on Tuesdays, duckin' the sweep
Nigga jump off, then get pumped off your feet
I'm like Rostein, low key and brilliant with numbers
I'm tryna blow sticky in Brazil with the Hummer
If you spittin' and I'm grippin' this tech
Then that's 32 shots, our throwback's like Mitchell and Ness
Man, I'm a project nigga, still piss on the steps
And keep the brim on my fitted a little twist to the left
I play the block, fifth in my sweats, reppin' my set
It's Rossie from the pharmacy, get it correct

Yo, it's Bunky S to the A, and my guns ain't warm
Beatin' niggas close to death with my house slippers on
You ain't a thug cocksucka, you a coward to front
Fuck your project, your building got flowers in front
Every chick I roll with, OZ in the cunt
I was OT in Mass, pushin' flower for months
Sprinklin' gun powder, oughta put a haze on my blunt
I spit a hundred and fifty bars when I'm blazin' 'em out
Cause I can do that with razor blades stuck in my mouth
Forget a hotel, I'm fuckin' shorty right on the couch
Any rap shit I ever barked on, to hot to handle
And my rims bigger than lower Manhattan manholes
Listen up for 2003 tan rover
Stash box hold guns like Afgan soldiers
Wanna murda 16, well we the niggas you call
Queen Bee and Gotti Kids, muthafuck all ya'll

[Verse 4: Vee]
Uh, yo Vee The Kid, that's the name I earned in the streets
Cause my bars so hot, it be burnin' the beats
Melt my pen, I have slugs meltin' your chin
When I throw you over the bridge, they helpin' you swim
And you better wear a metal hat when you rappin' on stage
Or have my bullets like e-mail, packin' your waves
Or snatch your face off like I'm Nicolas Cage
And it could be five of ya'll, puttin' eight in your grave
Cause niggas think they hard, but they softer than bread
When them shells hit your throat, you be coughin' up lead
The next step is to off you, dead
I'mma cut your fuckin' head off and have Kim auction your head (Beehive)
See the kid don't rap for love, I rap for cheques
Even if I know you, I demand respect
And if I put you in the body bag, your man is next
The Advakid and Queen Bee gon' leave the game in a mess (Beehive)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Goldie]
It's young Goldie, the Advakid, put you to rest
I ride around with two 38's tucked in my sweats
A pump in trunk and a nine under the seat
Enough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet (Beehive)
And we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl
Snippers put red dots on your face like freckles
Don't make me have to reach for the lead
You'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head
I'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot
She only with me cause of what she think I probably got
Am I gon' be with her for long, probably not
Unless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop
Niggas talk about guns and they just bust caps
Niggas talk aboit ki's whey they just flip packs
When it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that
Cause you know bullets fly in pairs like Petey Pab

Bitches wanna front on 'em
Know not to come in
I keep ten Glocks, ten rocks up in front of 'em
Like they sprayin' somethin', like they sayin' somethin'
Get my bark on like I'm DMX or somethin' (what?!)
My music's like Lewis, stiff 84
Yours is like Evander, seventy-seven slow
Thanks to Tae Bo, I'm 32 and ""O""
When I catch a knock out, bitches bring the cops out
Two for five spots, I tear the rocks out
Pop the tops out, they clear the spot out
Nigga or bitch, you don't want no problems
My revolver is a quick problem solver
Don't ever think I'm slippin'
Bitch I ain't dumb
I carry a stun gun inside of my hair bun
Hatin' ass niggas, I treat you like a bitch
Strap on a fake dick, and stick you where you shit (ha ha)

Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come you all, come and hail the Queen

[Lil' Kim]
Took three years off to map my shit out
Switch up my game plan and get closer to God
Give me an inch, I take a yard
Oh lighten up, ya'll knew I was comin' back real hard
By the power that's vested in me
Faith rested in me
I can't quit now, too much money's invested in me
To my nigga B-I, this ones for you baby!
All these niggas wanna be Kings, but fuck, is these niggas crazy?
Imma hold the spot for ya (yeah!)
Keep it locked for ya (yeah!)
Rock for you, Pop, ain't a nigga I won't drop for you
Bitches want my title, there ain't a slot for you
It's a cold, cold world, I keep it hot for you

Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing

[Lil' Kim]
Put five carats on the ""Fuck you"" finger
Any haters in the crowd, give them the ""Fuck you"" finger
If you think you can ball with the Queen
Handle repercussions
Our guns bust in English and in Russian
На здоровье королева мы говорим по русский до свидания
Niggas stand in line, pay a fee for me to kiss 'em
Twenty-one's the lucky number, once the ""E"" is in the system
One night with the Q.B., and niggas need maturity
Keep my pussy tight like the President's security
I'm sometimin', that's right, I change like the year
Bring chips from the Casino, then throw them in the air
I'm the Queen!
I've got special privileges
We ain't equivalent, how dare you insult my intelligence
Now I would like you all to recite the words to this song
Cause you thought I was goin'
But the Queen lives on!

Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing

I introduce to you (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)

Where Brooklyn at?)
Ladies and Gentleman...

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

[Hook: Mashonda]
This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)

No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars
This is who I am

[Hook: Mashonda]
This is who I am (This is who I am)

No, no, no (No, no, no)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718

[Hook: Mashonda]
This is who I am (This is who I am)

[Verse 1: Twista]
Here come a bitch with the fly puss', and a nigga with the fly dick
In the Mickey and Mallory mode, rollin through the streets on 24's, on krunk screamin, ""Die bitch!""
Bout to shut yo' shit down, anybody that opposes to payin us a fee false
If the straps don't bleed y'all, we put stitches in yo' motherfuckin dome like a league brawl
(Come and roll with this) Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this, it's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin haters 'buked and on crutches, niggas you cannot touch this
It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv, between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord, meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, cause I'm full of ambition and ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin on no critical condition, murderin is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it, don't when to stop it, I'm goin pockets and layin bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them, we got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi-Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain, then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

[Chorus]
You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
It's the T-W-I-S to the T-A, K to the motherfuckin I-M
Bout to shut yo' shit down, other albums come out ain't NOBODY gon' buy them
Now who gon' deny them? I'm scared of myself, don't nobody wanna try Kim
Y'all know you done fucked up (now whassup - y'all better come roll with us)
Who's you Mister? It's Lil' Kim and Twista (and we about this)
For those who doubt this, the game is ours (we gon' run you up out this)
What a wonderful feeling when you're stealin a million, but the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high, don't want no problems - JUST GIMME WHAT I CAME FOR!
Pull up on your block, eight straight Hummers, bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers, ain't no room for you whack newcomers
We the people's choice because we kick that, Nasty ""Hardcore"" shit that you wanna hear
Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the year
Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss, bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this, all my niggas wave that bling on the wrist
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

[Chorus]
You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us

[Twista] Kim is yo' flow hot? [K.I.M.] Like a gun shot [K.I.M.] Twist' is yo' flow cold? [Twista] Well I think so

[Lil' Kim]
Do it like a gangsta, creepin like a murderer, strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin for the ones we at war with, when we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome

[Twista]
Hear me Ma we can run this Earth together, come up worse than ever
Havin big dreams while we back up this work together
Let's set up shop on the block now, takin over yo' tip, even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

[Chorus Two: Lil' Kim]
Do it like a hustler, Lil' Kim and Twista, might as well ride with us
Male groupies, girl groupies, they're all gon' side with us
Whatcha gon' do, it's the Duke and the Duchess, you need to give it up
We gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

[Chorus]
You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us

Blessed by the God, so I be the Earths

Pack with steel, engines filled with Benjamins
I got half a mill stashed in the [boat station]
For womanizers and a hand full of hoes that hate
But lately, it seems people make the world go round
From A to Z, I break 'em down alphabetically
Pethtically, I puts the pressure
In ya Jones bet you fall like a Motorol Burn Out
Flip ya jacks and ya snitch ass back, to the cell of your block
HDM lock, and I wish you would stop
All that bawlin', cryin'
Lyin', 'cause this black Queen is shinin'
You didn't know I was Lieutenant, bitch, well that's primary
You just a secondary secretary
Envy against me
Because I stay laced in Ellen Tracey, Dolce & Gabanna
And people love me for my style, my personal
Niggas go wild and want to have my child
Bet I just sit back and enjoy
The optimism given from a girl to a boy (that's what it's all about)
It's all about the ones the guns just another day that earth lose a son

It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
We all know what it means to be broke, breaking niggas off
For some X and some Smoke , some like to mix it with rocks
Trees I like 'em fine, straight up marijuin'
And I put the lent in ya dents
Then you'll be stressed out with no dollars and no cents
Dressed in gear from last year, that you bought
Before you quit your job at the airport
Thinkin' you gon' make a mill from this rap game
But you labeled as a lame and it's a damn shame
No fame, no name, show no shame
Who's to blame? (Tell me [?] you want it)
Now you wanna lick a shot 'cause you ain't got
Get props, runnin' up in niggas' spots
Just a little gets to make cash
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash
Quick fast, get mad, 'cause ya man's in my whip
Honey, button ya lip 'cause my clit is too thick
It's all about the guns, the ones
Just another day that the Earth lose a son

But we can get our freak on some quick shit (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Tonight's the night shorty you'll never forget this
I dim the lights, I get it right, I'm like a pimp sick
Down on the bed, I make the clothes disappear quick
I see through her (?) La Perla pretty clear kid
I'm turned on now I really wanna hit, kiss
Her neck and nibble 'til I'm way down on her waist kid
Man she's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off
When she come in with a friend, I'm like ""Take it off!""
I got a fetish for the cheddar, yeah I'm rich bitch
That don't mean I'm runnin' 'round buyin' chicks shit
You see the chrome doubt be shinin' on my new six
My pinky ring, my neck, my ears and my wrist lit
I like the ice I'm pretty nice on the dice trip
Twice in a row you know, I got to get the dough
My confidence is high, I know I could hit a lick
My g's pretty good, I know I could get the bitch

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
I'll be your wife, I'll be your girl, I'll be your mistress
But if you ain't spendin' that dough your gettin' dismissed
That mean you gotta keep me laced like a seamstress
You can't expect nothin' less from the Queen Bitch
My doggy style make you wanna jump on that (BO!)
Just like a dog on that chase for the kitty kat (BO!)
Man he's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off (BO!)
He pour the honey on me, and then he clean me off (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)
I take his breath away, Kim leave 'em speechless
I'm so wet, I'll have a nigga feelin' sea sick
He in the streets all day but it's alright
'Cause he'll be back tonight, and then the next night
And then the next night, because the sex tight
I'll be his Advil, I gotta keep his head right
He outta town and he fiendin' for me every night
He's so addicted sendin' for me on the next flight

Runnin' deep with money and jewelery and holdin' myself down
Connected to every heavy nigga across the U.S
My cocaine is the whitest and my diamonds are the bluest
My city is the trillest and my niggas are the truest
Got everything to gain and nothing to lose, so let's do this
We load 'em up, cock 'em back, let 'em go we knock 'em off
Cut off all his cake, rocks, and eggs, this nigga block 'em off
It's B-U-N for UGK, straight up out that B-A-T

Big cars, big trucks, big nuts when it comin' up off the dust
Think it's funny 'til he comin' up out the club
Gonna getcha money when I'm comin' up out the cut
If I catch a nigga slippin', I'mma tell a nigga know that shit
Then I snatch that chain
When he leave his friends, I'mma get him out his ends
And his Benz, make him cash that train
Come out the dark and get the lights on
Turn together, get it up
Take his watch, take his bracelet, take his dust, take his truck
I can't help it to get itchy if I see the nigga ballin'
Nigga yes ya'll then I gotta get a piece of that
Steady figure with the Jacob in the bezel with charm
Well come over hear I got a little heat for that
AK-47 and the Desert Eagle with a sawed-off pump
Got a what, an E-95 with leather grip
And a Mac-11 comin' out the trunk
Got what, a black ski mask and leather gloves
And duct tape I can get what I want

But like that dance, I'm a shake 'em off right now

Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block

Put money on the table, pass the pepper and salt please
Moving too fast, take it slow like R&B

Blanco, Kimmy B, Urs, the same thing
Ain't shit change, going hard for the whole team
Got niggas on my line, I ain't hanging no clothing
A bitch been crack, just living this dope dream
I'm talking 'bout Bulgari on the charm, Piguet on the arm
Limited edition Giuseppes
You know I got the shooters from the turf that'll pop you like Percs

Got niggas mad cause I'm in my bag like groceries
My team wild, better watch how you approach me
I get a OG to punch you right in your gold teeth
Yo, I'm wit' my girl Kim, girlfriend go harder than grown men

If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money?  I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect

Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than ""Jaws""
With or without my boys, I still make noise

Look out the window, and reach for the stars

I know y'all don't wanna see Kim on top
Please stop worryin about what I got
What the fuck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator

Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel
Who me? That's none of your concern
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs
Pussy flawless, get wetter than worms
If you only knew like Aaliyah
How your man be hawking me and stalking me
When he fucking you he see me
Every crack vial or record he sell I get a piecey
Easy, believe me, my words is credible
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die

Leave you amazed, and keep the fifth by the rib cage
All you jealous ass hoes', rebellious ass hoes'
Still trying to recoup off the first album ass hoes'
You a gangster? Prove it. Wanna shoot me? Do it
That's word to Jerry McGuire, I'll set that ass on fire
Tie you up with barbed wire, carve my name in your face
Pour gasoline on you, drop you at the gas station
Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyurethane
Cocoa butter cream, vaseline and drugs baby like codeine
Low self-esteem? Uh-uh, the flow is excellent
Yours is satisfactory, return them to the factory
I mean practically, the shit is wack to me
Mama bear, finally out of hibernating
Here to tell you chicks to stop tail-gating

Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
It's the B-I-G-M-A-M-A
Often tipsy, cabin in Poughkeepsie
I've been in this shit since Biz hit the
One-two, nothing left to do
Move it in there, cathedral ceilings
Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings
P.Diddy introduced me to the business side
Spotted me a few mill and a couple of oil spills
That's how we do it, you chicks is no frills
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
Stealin' tricycles, ridin' bicycles
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
On the countdown (giggles) - don't make me laugh
Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff
They say we twins, then I'm the better half
I'm nasty! Worse than Howard Stern
This court is adjourned, and now it's your turn, bitch!

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Can you feel me?
I just wanna know if y'all can feel me
I just wanna know if y'all can feel me out there
It's not a game, we're back
And this time we're not going anywhere
Number one, that's my bitch
Recognize! Ya feel me?",Lil’ Kim,
"[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Gimme that work
Gimme that work
You know that I got you babe
Show me what it's worth
Gimme that work, work, work, work, work
Gimme that work, work, work, work, work

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I could never doubt you babe
Always by your side, always down to ride
Don't want to do this without you babe
Cause I can't see me without you in my life
Sit back and let me sex you up
Do not want to let you down
Baby boy let me fill you in
I can tell that you're built to win
Let me [?]
Choke me [?]
I am oh so into you
Let me fuck you slow
Please don't let me go
I just might fall in love with you

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
What'd you have for lunch today baby?
Would you like dessert?
Got my schoolgirl skirt on
I'm about to give you brain like a nerd
Now baby can you take me down
Cause I been out for way too long
You know these drinks got me too gone
You know this weed smoke got me on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
What you need work? I could give you that employment
Half a million dollar coupe just for my enjoyment
Bitch I got that work, el trabajo
If I run out I just hit Pablo
Mi no play no games, mi no come with console
Mi too wild in these streets, no control
Forty on me now and your nigga is the driver
He left you because your pussy was too dried up
And I got him mind fucked
G500 truck
Hundred thousand dollar shopping spree and I ain't bought him nothing
Rollies with the bezel on it
PJ with the medal on me
Hop up out the jet in a Bugatti
It's the one and only Queen Bee nigga, if it's about my cheese
I need a CC nigga if you sending that word out
It's like the cops raiding, how I'm sending them birds out
Ten toes down, I'm that bitch that you heard 'bout
Fucking with this pussy I could put you on the map
Fucking with this pussy I could take you out the trap
Yeah I rock Giusseppes, but Louboutins mi prefer
Let him purr on my kitty and buy mami some furs",Lil’ Kim,
"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I bend it down, I touch my toes
I do the splits, then fuck the floors
Suck your dick, then fuck some more
Get on top and ride it slow
Wanna stay on till I explode
Dynamite, time control
I make you take it back, Delorean
Then hold your breath and stretch it out, accordion
Spread my legs, lick my clit
So good, make you bite your lips
He on that Mike Tyson shit
This bitch not to be fucked with
And you better not cum quick (why?)
'Cause me and my girls love to suck dick
Brand new mattress, break the frame
Pussy so good make you say my name

[Hook]
She work the pole
(She a working girl, she work the pole)
She work the pole
(She a working girl, she work the pole)
She work the pole
(She a working girl, she work the pole)
She work the pole
(She break it down, she take it low)

[Chorus]
Oooh, he can lick the clit
When I sit on it I'm riding it
Oooh, I'm riding it
Oooh, he wanna take me down
He wanna take me down, he wanna take me down
He wanna take me down
He can take me down, he can take me down
He can take me down
He wanna take me down, he wanna take me down
He wanna take me down
He can take me down, he can take me down
He can take me down
He eating it when I'm riding it, oooh

[Outro]
Let's get nasty, let's get nasty",Lil’ Kim,
"[Intro: Mister Cee]
Now this shit right here
Goes out all my cats from New Jerus
That's New Jersey to you and me
C'yeah, drop that shit

[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
I'm all about my paper, ain't messin' with the majors
Told my nigga ""Uh, and get the one's we can do this""
No more J.M., it's La Bella to the death
It's the clique, so get with the movement
Now I'm collecting cheques, settle for nothing less
Same broad, the awards, exposing the breast
Y'all been frontin' and lyin', snitchin' and tryin'
But now I'm free
You wanted honey, to try and catch the Bee
Actually, I'm internationally known
No HIV but my status is full blown
A few rocks and stones, but I'm keepin' it grown
Got my own Gucci store, beside of my home
And if you, don't understand my actions
Just know there's a method to my madness

[Queen Latifah Interlude]

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Some MCs are old and arrogant
Try to make a name by dissing and competing
Niggas just like to spend cash
Cum fast, cos my pussy's so sweet
A diabetic wanna eat it first
Some people hate, and choose to talk trash
I brush it off and let it pass, like Steve Nash
Quick, fast, I get up in that ass
Kim's fast, and put hole on four blasts
This bitch, what you make I take half
I dare you to put your hands in my stash
Dudes dates girls who try to be like me
My pimp game so good make you leave wifey
New York's finest, call me Your Highness
And know there's a method to my madness

[Queen Latifah Outro]",Lil’ Kim,
"[Intro]
Uh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
You are not alone (Not alone)
Matter of fact, I'm in the other room (Other room)
I'm just watching you niggas with the scope (Yeah)
Got the drop on you niggas
At any given time, it could go down
You are not alone (Not alone)
Have niggas in your crib, when you not at home
I am not alone (Nah), I got hitters that you've never seen
You bitches better watch your tone
'Cause any given time, it could go down, down
If we talking drip, I got that shit that make you drown, drown
Everybody know that I'm the trendsetter, yeah, yeah
Past, present, future, no one do it better, no, nah, no, nah
You are not alone, no, no, no
Niggas leave them broke boys alone (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Your nigga blowing up my phone (What what, what what, what)
He kinda cute too, you better get him
'Cause at any given time, it could down
We are not alone (Not alone)
His girl is in the other room (Other room)
But he's here with me and it's plain to see we got chemistry
But any given time, it could go down
All these black bottles of Patron
But the Henny got me feeling like Jill Scott on the microphone
Haters, please leave my life alone 'fore your life be gone
Any given time, it could go down, down
You are not alone, I'm always there like your shadow
Haters throwing shots, but ain't got enough ammo
I get low in these streets like a army fatigue Lambo
I camouflage well in this Valentino camo
I dismantle any competition to the coalition
What Big started, I'm 'bout to finish
You witness greatness every time I spit this
Like a judge, an overdue sentence
Haters, please leave my life alone
You should never compare diamonds to a rhinestone
I'm like Khaleesi on the Game of Thrones
Get under your skin and burn your flesh and bones
Haters, please leave my life alone
Please leave my life alone
Please leave my life alone
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though you always hate, all you do is make me great
Leave my life alone
Haters, please leave my life alone
Please leave my life alone",Lil’ Kim,
