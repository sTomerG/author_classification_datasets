"[Verse 1]
Coming out the bottom of the mother fucking totem pole
Calling everyone who ain't believe like ""I told them hoes""
Now they on my scrotum though
And I've been grinding so long its like I gotta blow
Baby mama calling up my phone, what the fuck you want
Cause I don't owe nobody shit stop askin'
Haters get off of my dick, stop gaggin'
They know I'm schooling them, they tell me stop classin'
We already know that you the shit stop gassin'
Eck, and my flow is fucking sick dog
Make a bitch cough like a sick dog
Probably cause I spit raw
No fucking with this boy
Other rappers more uncool than when the fridge off
Damn I think my lid's off, more mental then Sig Freud
Mind like a mother fucking-unsolvable jigsaw
People ask my audience ""what you listen him for?""
Shit..cause I don't think Lil Wayne's come this hard
My God, then what that mean
Since I ain't son to nobody, then I must be king
Cocky with it, cause I know that can't nobody stop me with it
Wanna try? be ready to die, Kamikaze with it
Fuck a prince, I know I'm the real shit ya dig
Cause ain't no-mother-fucking-body done the shit I did
I'm the man where I'm from, but they call me the kid
Give me the crown cause if not then we taking that bitch
Mother fucker

[Verse 2]
100 words and running, 100 rappers that I ate still in my stomach
And 100 other coming, hustling for one-hundred a-hundreds
I don't give a fuck what you say, give me my money
Not college educated, but I can count a shit load
Connected like a constellation I can get you shipped more
Boy I do numbers with these verses check the info
I'm Machine Gun Kelly what the fuck's a pistol
What the fuck's a white flag
What the fuck's a price tag
What the fuck is beef? Fuck it show me where's the mics at
I will tear each one of them mother fuckers a nice ass
No homo cause we don't get dicked, we ain't like that
Nah bitch, should've hollered at me before
Cause ""fuck you pay me"" is now my steelo
And that goes for promoters, for the shows
For the verses, for the hoes
For the labels, what you owe
Bitch, give me my dough
I'm the big baller, shot caller of my age
19-year old Dwayne Wade
And the Eastside on my back, no matter what they weigh
Clevelands number 23 like I ain't know Lebron played
So what's up to all my fans who held me down since day one
Telling them Kells' the hardest that they come
Gave the real what they want and I did that
So come and blow a blunt with your boy give it here let me split that
And I bet they won't forget that
Cause rappers forgot how to be real
Forgot how they used to be before the deal
But I remember still
That's why I'm not a member of fame
Just raw talent who remembers the game
And the name, Kells",Machine Gun Kelly,100 Words And Running,
"[Intro]
And if I must go and die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Now, will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive inside forever
And feel me forever
They say I need to slow down, but I don't know how

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Real feelings from past dealings
When people counted me out 'til I grew up to count millions, uh
Like I guess it's good to be different, huh?
I'm a star so the sky isn't the limit, huh?
I'm living like it's my last day
Smoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray
Smile as if no one hated at all
As if anyone understood anytime I evolved
Tell me, what do you do when what you dream comes true?
Buy a Bentley and look just like you?
How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous
And all the pain is created?
I need to overdose on inspiration

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you just go home?
Well, I can't right now, I'm a rolling stone

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
And if I must go, and fly away
And kiss my baby girl goodnight
And if this really is goodbye
Then let's set the city on fire
Can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Now, can you take me higher?
Can you take me higher?

[Post-Chorus]
If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
If I must go, die at 27
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever

[Outro]
I let these words seep through my soul
And speak through the song
'Cause if one day, I'm no longer here in the physical
Then at least I give you my voice to listen to
What is a beautiful life without a beautiful death?
What is a beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?
Is it for you to decide, is it my duty to die?
No matter how I'm remembered, just let me be remembered

Yeah, forever young, though
Always be those crazy kids running wide-eyed down the boulevard

I got fifty hoes on my dick bitch
Fifty o's in my zip bitch
Burn the roof off this muhhfucka like I got fifty stoves in my whip bitch 
We all smoking and driving
Might as well say that I’m flying
Might as well call me the pilot
Bitches in my cockpit I don’t check mileage
I just fuck my ho like I’m 'sposed to
And when she bring her friends I fuck both
I brought the bitch to thanksgiving
Why?
Cus she fucks with me when I’m broke
Ain't nothing funny about the way I get money
And them Cleveland boys ain't no joke
I’m the truth and the truth is hard to swallow
So you better tell these bitches don’t choke, echo
I got one bitch, I got two bitch, I got three bitch, I got four
I tell the fifth bitch to tell sixth bitch to get the seventh bitch to bring mo'. 
Ain't no hand cuffin cousin

Fuckin niggas hate that 
Bad bitches play back 
My pinky 80 stacks

Diamonds shining rocky ASAP
I told them I be pimpin on them bitches 
You can call me pimping ken
I fuck em once and tell em go and bring a friend

"[Chorus: phem]
Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the morning
Wide awake still, not even yawning
Not even sure why I'm up at dawn like I'm celebrating
When my agent told me that no one's calling
It's a ounce in my living room on the couch
Next to a couple homies that smoked it and passed out
So I'm alone with my thoughts in this glass house
In the cabinet are glass vials, I just poured all the last out
I smelled her, now she's on my mind
I met her the first time my light turned lime
Hate it when she's gone, but she ain't hard to find
Left her on my desk, she made designs in little lines

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ayy, look, I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the evening
In my head, talking to these demons (Demons)
In my bed, staring at these ceilings
I just bleached my hair and changed my whole appearance
I'm just fed up with these smoke and mirrors
My uncle sold some pictures of me with no clearance
What the fuck is family? I can't take that serious
Thank God everybody sucks so I can write these lyrics
Go pick her up, I need to lift my spirits
They don't know that we hook up, I don't let cameras near us
There's some shit I do, when she's around, I shouldn't share
Like that week I spent locked in a room with her in Paris (Fuck)

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
It's 5:3666

"[Verse 1]
Yo I was, raised on a seperate side of the track in the land where the wild things roam
Open up my closet see a tall leaf growin, pick a leaf off of the stem take it all to the dome
Callin it, the Alice in Wonderland, spiralin down the medium better known as time I'm stumblin
Come back to my senses from the sounds of thunderin, trees talkin to me wonderin if ill ever come again
Every single day until I'm seein the sun again
Starin at the ripples skippin rocks in the pond again
Stimulatin every single cell while I'm ponderin
And the green leaves are fallin and shrivelin like the Summer end
What shall I do, where do I go
I want the fumes in put the towel under the door
I'm feelin the dro, puff it in and releasin the smoke
Its not enough for me, I want it if u got it fa sho
There are, things talkin to me mommy I swear
I'm seein figures in the dark get up and nobodys there
Intangible shadows are fucking with me reaching for nuthin
So I take a hit of this Alice now I'm hopin for somethin
Fuck all the puffin, elmer it up get to the huffin
Treat it like christmas turkeys open up and get to the stuffin
See if I'm bluffin, I'm ready to go to the moon
Ill do whatever whenever promise it'll get me there soon

[Hook]
I'm lost in my own mind, where do I go
I swear This wonderland's not what I used to know
(voices in my head telling me to go to)
Wonderland (blisseded up feel the smoke run my hands)
Wonderland (twisted up, sip it chop it if you in)
Wonderland (Sit back let me how show u how it begin)
Wonderland (where my mind I think I lost in the end)

[Verse 2]
Take me to the twilight zone, no lights on
At the altitude where u be seein all the kites flown,(YEAH)
Family concerned and convinced that my mind gone
And they right, last night first class flights gone,HEY
Mommy why the fuck the flowypier gotta mouth now
Conversatin why I'm layin on the ground now
About face told me to get out now
See the revolution of tomorrow in the clouds now
So far gone, but I'm not Drizzy
Cleveland's own but I'm not Bizzy
Nope no bone well then who is he?
I don't even know anymore I swear I done went crazy (BAHH)
All this talk about the life and the ice in the right hands could get u the dream and a nice tan
But they don't say is the price is ya life plus a slice of ya soul as man and ya right hand
21 as long the cards set right
Drop on my saliva gave my card deck life
Queen of hearts tryna take away my best type
The Ace of Spade make a muthafucka bet right
Creepy crawlers tryna sneak up gimme bed bites
Hide under the cover keep intruders out my bed life
Hug the pillow keep it tucked under my head tight
So the toothfairy cannot get up in my head, night

"[Pre-Hook: Victoria Monet]
I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then i wake up to see the world's ill
Oceans tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish that i could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow.​

I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home

I think we all need a little more love
I think we all need a little more love
We just need a little more love

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells, In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
Cause it feels like the government just as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night i'm supposed to lose
Just ​'​cause in hindsight, they don't like my type:
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I think we all need a little more love

You can give up like they tell you, stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
​but I'm tryIng to tell you
Fuck what they tell you

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly & Victoria Monet]
​And in these dark times
​As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved it’s important to know we’re not blind
​We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
​And I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees if I can't live free
Right now in the world we just need
A little more love
A little more love

I'm all alone (all alone)
In the unknown (the unknow)
So on my own (on my own)
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone (uh)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
What I'm gon' do now?
I'm going through withdrawls from this loneliness
I'm captain of my ship, without a crew now
Sinkin in the deep end, I ain't even in the pool
Broke the mirror cuz I'm sick of knowing all I got is you now
My knuckles bleeding, my back is against the wall
Screaming at my shadows, they ain't saying nothing at all
I'm going crazy, conversation when nobody talks
So tell me how my ears are ringing, when ain't nobody's called
Huh? Yeah
But in this life of mine, friends are expendable, living in a life of crime
Every morning pillows soaking, from the nights of crying
Knowing the choice is either jail or dying
But here we go

[Pre-Chorus: Collin Hilton]
Here we go, down this lonely road
Searching further for something more
In this dark world, I'm so alone
Can someone rescue me from my own

I'm all alone (all alone)
In the unknown (the unknown)
So on my own (on my own)
Someone help me light the way
I'm all alone (all alone)
In the unknown (the unknown)
So on my own (on my own)
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, in a position I wasn't ready to take
Pushin' the countless decisions I wasn't ready to make
But I do it, refuse it I can't
Its stupid as faith
This is the life I chose and I dont have room for mistakes
But everyday I wanna give up
Stomach hurtin like I did a sit up
Anxiety tightens my throat like a hiccup
Thinking about the things in my past I can't get rid of
Every single thing I eat I gotta spit up
And every time I get up my world is spinning, so where am I facing
Can't stop thinking, my mind is racing
Somebody come get me outta here, cuz now my only hopes of escaping is the sound of a (bang)
Please save me

"[Verse 1]
Ay yo
This that shit you bob your head to
This that brand new instrumental
I heard he puts his city on
That boy Kells so influential
Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration
Cause how we supposed to know that what we dream is possible
If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

[Hook]
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

[Verse 2]
Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Feel that, uh
Lace up, Kells
Lace up, Kells

Yeah, staring out into the unknown
Voices in the wind telling me to come home
But I'm scared
Scared that all this time I've been gone
I’ll open up the door and my little daughter will be grown
And I’m cold, tell me why I'm so cold?
Probably cause a shoulder turns every night that I’m on the road
Probably why I can’t smile every time that I’m on the phone
And why I'm acting so wild every time that I’m alone
Save me!
I suffocate myself beside the bed
Tryna cut the circulation of these thoughts inside my head, like
""Do I hate me? Or do I hate them?""
Either way I've held grudges since I was holding a pen
My father had me think that my cousin was dead
Just to hide me from the truth, how can I look at him again?
But this is life, and in life we learning to live

Question, what if tomorrow never comes?
And everything you said today couldn't be undone?
Cause all it takes is a bullet from one gun
To take another’s moment away from them, one love I know
See I was just an only child growing up
Just frowns cause I never seen a smile growing up
But you? You were a friend, always down growing up
Give the word, knew you would’ve blown trial growing up
Fuck! How could we let all this petty shit blind us?
How the fuck did we let the devil find us?
See, we were supposed to be best friends 'til the end, you promised
How’d it take that fucking night to remind us?
I only said I hated you cause you're the only one that’s ever honest
Man I said I was wrong, let’s get beyond this
But it’s crazy, cause I never thought my text apologising
Would be the reason that you died driving

Where I’m from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa
Roll through these streets come up gone like Bermuda
I’m just a boy in the hood like I’m Cuba
So soon as I moved out I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here, she'll go down like a scuba
All of y’all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y’all shits in the ditch like a sewer 
Make all of y’all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas

(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Verse 2]
If you ain’t living your life then you’re dead
And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement, I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was 11
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My dad saw his son as a nuisance, a rebel, and (ahh!)
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he’d go back to his Kettle One vodka
And drink it all up till he's mental
I have no issue, I am official
Let them come at me I practice Jiu Jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters dawg
That's G-O-D, God and my fucking initials
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered
Said I’m the first of a species that they call a real muthafucka, (Kells)
And I’m sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way then positive
But you shouldn’t be hollering or talking about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis
And if you follow astronomy I’m a Taurus
That means I don’t give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview looking like a lobotomy
Flipping my middle finger at everybody who watching us, (uh)
Fuck that bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Nah, fuck that where the keef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed sack
Give me a minute I took a hit I'm tryna focus like astigmatism
My competition on my dick, they're like the zip on my denim
They want the heat I light em up like I put cigarettes in 'em
You bitch, whats your religion?
I wanna know what God you’re seeing in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism bout my lyricism
When I’m in your face rippin' this rhythm up like canabalism
Its Kells

(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)

I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?

"[Intro]
You know, it's funny
It's like, when I {*record scratch*} on somebody
Everybody felt like I owed them answers to everything
But it's cool
This how MGK handles the situation
Haha

[Verse 1]
They be saying ""Kells why you leaving now?
You bounced and never came back around""

Look I'm still in the city I just don't leave the house

""Well what's this talk about you acting all crazy?
They say you getting Hollywood""

Shit, fuck them, pay me

""I'm saying, you won't even collab with another artist?""

Wrong, it's just that half of these rappers out here retarded
There's only 2 reasons why I wouldn't do a song
Either it isn't beneficial or that money isn't long

""Damn, it's like that?""

Unfortunately it is
Cause no cheddar equals out to no food for my kid

""Hold up, you got a kid too? How old is you?""

I'm 19 but I deal with grown man issues

""Okay cool, at least we know you not no fool
But you look like a college boy, why you not in the school?""

Cause I was in the principal's offices more than the class
Wouldn't write a letter of recommendation for my ass
See most of the teachers hate me, right along with the kids
Cause my reputation outside of the campus was getting big
Biatch
Haha, yeah it's like that

""Oh it's like that?
Okay okay, but I ain't done brah""

[Verse 2]
""Okay, you're confusing me
I always see you in the hood
But you look like them white boys from Laguna beach
So what are you? A Thug or an 'Asher Roth'?""

Look, I'm none of that, I'm the whole entire catalogue
From front to back the perfect blend like camouflage
Because I'm still me, even when the camera's off

""Well I been hearing about some things
You false bragging where you from?
So what city is it? Help me understand this, son""

Look I was born in H-town, raised in the middle east
Seen every part of the world from the ghetto to the beach
But unfortunately that was all before I turned 9
So the experience wasn't appreciated by my young mind

""Yeah get to the point""

Chill brah, let me talk

""Well explain the two area codes thats tatted on your arms""

Okay my left one is for Denver and my right is for The Land
Better known as Cleveland, Midwest is what I am
Next time you wanna question, understand this fam
I represent cause those the cities that taught me to be a man

""Okay, I guess I didn't see everything on the plate""

Well next time you wanna question get your facts straight
Biatch

[Verse 3]

""Damn
I guess that was cool and all, I dig that
But you not off the chain yet homeboy""

Oh yeah? You got some more?
Aight, come on brah
Let's go

""So what you got besides your name that makes you think you so cool?""

I won first at the Apolo, what more do I gotta prove?
The first rapper to do it
Plus on top of that, I'm staring at my '09
Best live performance award plaque

""Yeah, well how many fans you got?""

Thousands

""Prove it""

I'm on every major blog with no album

""Sure, but anyone with a deal gets that respect""

Wrong, cause I did this without a major label check

""so you saying you not signed?""

No, I had no help
I earned everything that I got then I signed myself

""Damn, you must be ballin', wheres the chains and the whip?""

I'm far from rich and the only jewels that I cop's for my chick

""What about your boys?
How'd you get them all to be down?
How much you pay?""

None dude, we from the same side of town
And if win, split up the chips and for the moment live good
But if not, we still fam like we back in the hood

""Friends? I respect that
What about the haters?
Word is you got a couple cats jacking your flavor""

Hell yeah, a couple people out to down my name
Turn on the radio the songs and the style's the same
Befriended me to stab me in the back, they lame
Should be ashamed, but all is well
It's just the rules of the game
Man
Haha yeah, wow its crazy

""That definitely was crazy man
'Preciate you answering the questions though man
Clearing it all out
You gotta tell 'em your name tho
Go ahead""

Somebody reach inside of it
It be the ones that don't say none of that
Got the biggest size inside in them
I was that lame kid, that sixth grade kid
Back of the class, look like a nerd
But not the biggest brain kid
But it was that same kid
That made the game flip
Man of the city
Now everybody know the name kid
Where are my sleepers at
I mean my dreamers at
Cause I use to dream
About this moment in my sleeping bag
Look where I'm speaking at
Imagine eating at Italian shops in Italy
Like where my Visa at?
Then take another seven forty seven
To the states the same day

My pockets are swelled up
Even when the weathers colder
Convertible folder
Chilly diamond chains in my rings rose golder

Like I'm having a baby now
Had to get a little chilly
Cause my tummy wasn't officially there
But I'm craving now
All that good life Kanye
Was talking I finally figured out
It ain't bout my ends
Its bout my friends family and making out
And if I would sold my soul
Imagine what I'd be
So what if I ain't the most successful
It was meant to be
I learned to cope with all these emotions mentally
Express it through my music
My everyday is a symphony
This is for the bird
This is for the block
This is for the nerd
This is for the jock

You want it magical
Look inside of yourself
Its autobiographical
Its so easy to think
Things are owed to you
But is those same desires
That grow old to you
Just love
Life live
Good take advantage
To any opportunity
You should
And when they say you can't
Go respond and do it
I did the same and
Achieved what no other rapper could
And it don't matter where your from
Its where your headed to
If you rather than what they said before
Its what I'm telling you
Half of these people
Don't want to see you get a damn thing
Wanna pull you out the fast lane
And park you handicap man
From the streets to the crib
From the beach to the bridge
From the hood to the coldest [?]
Don't let them hold you back
I spark the anthem and
Gave you the flame burn with it

You want me down

Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

And you are not a girl your a goddess

She in the kitchen whippin cheese eggs with the same hand that she rolled the Js with
6 inch heels
5 course meals
4 years she's been my 32, my center like Shaquille
One time for my bad bitches
Whose mouths are sacreligious, cuz magic is a sin, and my dick always vanishes
Pictures on the cam of me shakin her ass
Cuz we drunk and wanna make this moment last
And the way yo back arch, when u lay on that cushion
The way yo toe's curl blowin smoke rings on the pussy
Make that muthafucka cream, from squeezin on her cookie
She want me to make her scream, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Police wanna lock me down, haters wanna shut me up
Bitches fuckin with me now, u was with me coming up
So Ima hold u down cuz u the only one that I can trust

Dropped out and now she pop it-pop it-pop it like the twerk team muthafucka
Embarrassed of the fact that she a stripper
But maybe that's the reason that I'm with her
Gave me excuses to fuck with these other hoes, while she dancin on a dick
Knowin that she can't say shit
Fighting every single night, but we fuckin every day,
But She know how to hold her own, and she do everything I say
Bad bitch,

 Left class just to pick me up and smash
We ain't even go inside I just fucked her on the dash
Bad boy, so she love it when I smack her on the ass
Friends jealous cuz they wantin what she have
Scars underneath my tatts, she be worried I just laugh
Sit back and roll a zig zag up with some hash and let it ash
Cuz if the world crash then at least we already fell into love
And the J already burnin so wassup, muthafucka 
It is us against the world so wassup, muthafucka

For what they wanted in life
This song is for everyone
Who had to sit through the dark days
Before they saw the light
For everyone who's been through it all
Shout out to my fans, man
This one's for y'all, baby!

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uhh, I been through it all
Crazy, because I never thought I'd say that (Naw)
The cost to be the boss, never thought I'd pay that (Not at all)
Headed to the top, without the friends I've had since way back
Near death experiences, watching my life play back
Damn, and I have never sold a brick
But I can show you where to get it
Like I can show you how to flip
My whole life has been a hustle
Since momma bounced on her kid
And I ain't never scared of drama
I was born up in the shit (Let's go)
Cause it was once upon a time, mu'fucker
We were fine and I was just a little snobby mu'fucker (Right?)
Then it changed, now these people wanna rob me mu'fucker (Oh)
New environment, now Pops' like ""Get a job muh fucker!"" (Whoo)
Yeah, so I did that, wasn't with that, so I quit that
Told them about my dreams and then they laughed
But I spit that, fire
Couldn't deny it, so the choir that would chip, yeah (What they do?)
Shut it up, and still I won't forget that
Man fuck y'all!
And I won't put that behind me (Behind me)
Even though I left the past (Past)
And I'm still the kid now (Now)
Even though I left the class (Class)
I'm on, and it took everything from A to Z to do it
So anything I'm talking, I've been through it

Look, in April I was born, at 14 I was a felon (Uhuh)
By 18, I had been to more funerals than a reverend (Damn)
And right when I felt like I'd give it up, look what they sent me
My beautiful baby girl straight outta heaven
And I loved you girl
And even though that was never part of the plan
And people doubted it because of who I am
Fuck, I hope they understand
That at 19 with the world in my hands
I stepped up and handled that shit like a man
I've been homeless, I've been broke
Done every drug 'cept for coke
I done fought for my life, been jumped, shot at, and more
I've been rich and I've been poor
Had to steal from the store on nights there wasn't shit to eat
And seen my best friends go
Damn, so what the fuck could you possibly say to me? (Huh?)
The verdict is I'm the truth, but you can thank today's jury (Yup)
But if you wanna judge, come walk a mile in my chucks
But the world sucks, better Lace Up, uhhgk

Okay, I've been made out be a monster
But the only thing aggressive about me
Is the will that I have to conquer
I told them I was the best
And they doubted, but no longer
Out of all the starving artists
They could hear my hunger (Sup?)
And if that's wrong then I don't wanna be right
I'm always dreaming so I'm gone in the night (Shhh)
And now it's reality
I'm calling home like ""I'll be gone on this flight""
But how can I contact a place that doesn't exist in my life?
Home, I guess that I'll just be alone for the ride
And live vicariously through another's eyes
Adding on to the list of lies
So my girl doesn't trust me for shit
Probably cause after my momma left I ain't trusted a chick
Shit, and my father drowning his problems with the bottle
While I'm praying my auntie can see tomorrow
Cause cancer ain't a joke
And I just lost one of my best friends to the pen
So I don't wanna live again

Crumblin' the herb and rollin' it up in the Swishers
Kush is my cologne, every minute blowin' heavy

All I do is flame shit, I don't do that change shit

Look at who I came with, better fix ya face quick
Cause I gotta lot of muh-fuckers with me we all on the same shit

Order up a quarter my connect is on the phone
Mix the purple with the lemon G kush and get stoned
God damn it im gone, blowin' with the wind

Size 12 Chuck Taylors what my feet is on
Laced up blazin' back to back like repeat a song
And fuck the police boy, I say it proud
And if they hear me fuck the police say it loud
20 dollars and a dream bitch I'm livin'
Back strokin' in yo girl, no swimmin'

Blue skies (see me)
There's nothing but blue skies

[Verse 1]
Look, never had a cent now I got a bent
I ain’t talkin Bentley’s, I’m talkin' a bitch
I got her bent over she bustin' them splits
Lookin' up at the star, I’m tellin' her make a wish
Hoes come around me tryna leave rich
But I give ‘em no shit so they leave pissed
Fuck ‘em, here's to the night, like Eve 6
My partner ain’t gotta put the dough in the deep dish
Mic check, can you hear me?
I’m loud as a symphony
Smoke in my lungs, I’m a chimney
Get it in your head like epiphanies
Realize I am Prince Akeem, I roll with the semi
So many repent me, part of ‘em resent me
They think I’m Lucifer, I think God blessed me
I was in hell while you rappers on Jet ski’s
How in the fuck can yo raps represent me?
I was on ten, now I’m on fifty
I just spent a hundred, tell ‘em roll it up quickly
I just got a hundred missed calls from the city
Keep it 100, everybody fuck wit me
Keep it 100, Kells, Keep it 100
Fuck ya’ll, you don’t know nothing
I keep it 3 thou like Andre
I done been an Outkast since I came up out mom's stomach
I been smoking weed since I was a fetus
Lil bad mothafucka, needed Baby Jesus
Tryna be a millionaire, where the fuck Regis?
Leaders of the new school and we all teachers
First lesson: blue skies, blue dream, red eyes and catch red eye
Fuck the real world, Kells

[Chorus]
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real

[Bridge]
If ya’ll ride wit me, roll one up and get high wit me
Turn it up and then vibe wit me, fuck the real world
If ya’ll ride wit me, roll one up and get high wit me
Turn it up and then vibe wit me
Kells!

[Verse 2]
24/7 I’m putting in work
Came from the gutter, no stain on my shirt
You know the Land is where champions birthed
So I hold the title till I land in the dirt
Motorcycles, auto-rifles, and purp
Overnight they think I tripled my worth
Gotta stay ready, these haters will lurk
But this ain’t what you want, now I’m feelin like Durk
(This ain’t what you want)
Sing that shit to ‘em like Gerald Levert
Couldn’t sleep on me with Ambien first
Let the kid nap like an Amber alert
Wake up and you know I had to get turnt
Bottle of Jameson matching my shirt
Back on the road, gotta pack up the merch
And I smoke so much tree that I damage the earth
Yeah, EST runs shit
Don’t make me get on my young shit
Don’t get me talking that gun shit
Don’t make me turn this whole thing to a function
Don’t make assumptions
I’m from the C, I ain’t talkin bout Compton
I’m from the 6, I ain’t talkin Toronto
Bitch I’m from Cleveland, you know the motto
I’m the city’s Lucky Luciano, the gunner!

My name is Kid Kells
??? around my neck I rock jew-els
??? cause my shit sells
I'm another plateau, level so high I see an-gels, farewell
That's why I walk it like I talk it, and I ain't saying nothing
So I guess that I ain't walking, I'm rolling in that 300
See I ain't no G, but best believe that I run it
I'll talk shit, I'm a hustler, talk money
Bank rolls, stash spots, shoulda, coulda, woulda, them have nots
Pants swole up from them cash knots and my roof lift back like laptops
Who is you kidding, y'all ain't living y'all are scraping
And as long as money talk, I can't hear none of y'all hating

BOUNCE, BOUNCE...and if you getting dough

Stop! Who told you it was cool to mess with this kid?
The city got me paid, so shouts out to my crib
I'm 18 and I got more soldiers than the president
That vanilla drop-top, same color as my skin
BOUNCE! Four-fifteens beat, I make this bass break grounds
This is that ??? that'll make them girls get down
On stage we whilin' until we hear that sound (woop woop)
It's the boys, clear out!
Hit the block in something crucial, polo buttoned up
All of the way up to the top with them fat laces in my Chucks
See I don't give a fuck, never really have
Your girl ain't all that cute, but I'll snatch her just cause I can
Always been the man, never claimed to be the hoodest
Real words couldn't describe me, so tell me who the goodest?
And if music lost its substance, this is hip-hop at its fullest
And if the rap game was a school, then I'd be all you rappers bullies

Can't nobody get on my level, get up and tell 'em what my name is Kells! (Drop it)
I was pullin dimes when I was a real little boy
And to this day I'm still hollering, still hustling
Still cussing, motherfuck you and the crew you run with
Never been a thang to get off my booty and make them calls and get this money
65 hundred out the trunk, first CD
Look at me now $10 a pop, making millions is easy
Can't nobody see me, and y'all buzzing like bees be
Still hating cause you jealous, y'all just wanna be me
Everything that I do we do the best, get your hating up
Where your money at? Trick please, get your paper up
And I'm in they hood, I must have lost my lid
Fuck 'em says my dirty mouth, I need Orbit
Then I look at my surroundings to find who's hating
There I think I found a pussy cat, yup sure did

No mercy has begun
Ladies and gentlemen
Machine Gun Kelly
This kid, I think he is a star
He's one of the best live performers I've ever seen
He's also more importantly a movement

[Verse 1]
Backpack? Fuck that
I was always hanging where the thugs at
I was always hanging with the rugrats
Someone come and show me where the drugs at
Someone come and pop on a hot song, meaning my shit, get an iPhone take a video and make it last long get some popcorn because I murder every single instrumental that I get on
And a muthafucka isn't gonna stop the shit
Until I make an album like a 2pacalypse
Until I'm killing everybody like in Auschwitz
Until I'm revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I'm poppin' all these bottles to accomplishments
Until I'm always hot no matter what the climate is
Until whenever somebody is feeling talkative my name is brought up, doesn't matter what the topic is
Didn't think I rap? Bitch I flow like ""boom boom bap""
Bitch I come from where you never moved at
Look into my room get a view, look at my past
God damn
Got weed, got jack, oxy's? Had that
Got Jimi, got Slash, got shrooms, got hash
Bipolar syndrome, kicked in, got mad
Walked on the red carpet like kiss my ass you bitch

(More Sound Clips of Various People talking about MGK)
He was truly the only developed on-point performer on the bill
If you know anything about lyricists, then you know who MGK is
I need a freestyle, I need to hear Machine Gun Kelly spit

[Verse 2]
Fuck that, y'all don't gotta hear shit
Ask anybody in the 216 if my name rings bells in them bricks
""Man everybody know who that is""
What you hate, boy? You late, boy
You ain't heard about that great boy?
3 letter name cacausian boy
Used to live right there up the way, boy
You heard about him, you've said the name
You saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and you bought the shit
Put him on the playlist right next to Jay
Then your girl saw me, I signed her tits
And she disappeared you couldn't find the bitch
Then your heart stopped you know what time it is
I put my dick in her common sense
Fuck boy you lonely
Fuck boy you phony
You would think these fuck boys fucking boys with the way that they be all on me
If it ain't EST in your mouth...then whatever you rep is corny
Got a new single without me on it? That shit's boring, bitch I'm snoring
Man I'm touring every damn day
I showed y'all how to turn up
100 j's in my ashtray bitch I showed y'all how to burn up
I sacrificed what y'all wouldn't give to these kids and now you love fans?
None of these rappers got a movement tell 'em quit jocking my ass
God damn...
And y'all can have the bloggers I don't type shit
God gave me both these hands to fight with
Wassup!?
Now say goodnight quick because my right fist's like Vicodin
Might just throw you on the ground like dices
Might just go into the pocket with your license, get a wallet and a couple dollars, buy nice shit
Dyke bitches all over my dick, that's priceless
I just fuck 'em if they're wet like Pisces
Wives is jealous of the bitch I'm with cause they almost F'd like D-...get it?
Digest every little word I'm spittin' cause it's food for thought so pay attention
Better listen, I’m on a mission to killing off all of my competition and if you are with that then good riddance muthafucka!

What are you trying to say, he's wack or something?

And I can't walk
Got me off of my shit man

I can't lie, dog, I'm so fried, dog
I'm so high, dog, this is my life
One night I'ma get it done
Can't stop 'til I see the sun
One bite, hit the drugs
Can't die, I'm too young
I feel just like Jimi back at Woodstock
What did you just give me in this Ziploc?
Blurred lines, blurred lines, I just fucked for the third time
Purple rain, purple rain fell in my cup, slurred rhymes

Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades
Y'all can't see my eyes behind these shades

Let me tell you a little somethin' 'bout me
I'ma finish what you getting started
So don't be fighting at my fucking party
'Cause I'ma fuck you up
Bitch thought of my crew, though
Don't blow my crew, though
Make room for the crew, though
I got girls in the front, huh
2 grams in the blunt, huh
Rolling up that funk, huh
I feel just like Ozzy back in '8-5
My girl's just want sloppy ice cream paint jobs
I served it up, I served it up
It's the young gunner, you heard of us
I just got in three fights
So I ain't slept for three nights

I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow

Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow

[VERSE 1]
The elevators broken, the stairs second room on the left
I seen my ex on my mattress sucking my dude for a check
She ain't say nuttin while he nuttin', she was in for the money
He in it from the back because even he knew he was frontin'
But you know, can't be too careful
In the hood, that's what they there for
Even your kin ain't your friend, they heart hollow as air holes
That's exactly how I spit it, it's exactly how I live it
Like a drunk man on his gimmick, ceiling fans still spinning
Turn around see the smoke fill up my living quarters
Packing gun shells dipped in water, that's what you go tell your daughter
Opened up the bathroom door and seen somebody shooting up
Peek-a-boo'd out those window shutters seen somebody shooting up
Bam, duck, bust, that's what procedure calls
Not knowing, not being involved but gets you locked behind them walls
I just lost one of my closest friends to the jury
Ceiling blades on the fan keep turning, and you know


[Chorus]
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow
I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sitting in my room watching ceiling fans in the wall
Ceiling fans in the wall, ceiling fans in the wall
Living for today because we never promised tomorrow

"[Intro]
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love but
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up?
Or should I just (ugh) keep on (yeah) chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements

“You know, it’s crazy, man
I never thought music could have got us this far
Y'all have no idea how many sleepless or hungry nights we spent
On the fucking floor and couches just trying to get to this point
But no matter how hard the road gets, you gotta stay the course man
Keep chasing these pavements ‘til you can’t run anymore
Lace Up!""

[Verse 1]
Uh, fall asleep until the dream comes
Muthafuck reality
Happiness, I think I need some
So I overdose on fantasy
My life's equation ain't complicated
Just a combination of hate is denominated as stated
No rest plus the sess and abusive prescription meds
Times stress equals out to be the muthafucking mess that is, Kells
The boy with no home
That's why I live in your speakers through this song
That's why they turn it up so loud the bass hits
And you can feel me when I'm gone
And when I die, spread my message like the Qu'ran
Muthafuckas getting paid, I'm just tryna get saved
7 years of living crooked, I'm just tryna get straight
All this crack in my city even though these street's paved
Makes me wonder if I should let all my life's dreams wait
Or should I -

[Hook]
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
(Or should I) Just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

[Verse 2]
Bored out of my mind, I need a fucking job
But they ain't hiring shit, that's why I fucking rob (Gimmie that)
Had to hustle cause unless you got them test scores
Colleges only come around here looking for Brett Favre
For the next star, or if you 6'4""
And if you can pitch, but other than that shit you just pitch raw
That's what I'm pissed for (Why?)
Cause if you ain't worth a couple of dollars
These scholars looking like ""what do we need him for?"" (Huh?)
I'm saying, just because I ain't Kareem
You telling me I should give up on my dream?
You telling me I ain't shit cause I ain't working for degrees or on a team?
This country's flag is a joke
That shit should be painted green
Tell me when was currency valued over a human being?
When we stand for nothing, we falling for anything (Yeah)
But EST's for life and that's exactly what I'll scream
Misunderstood until they answer one thing (What's that?)

[Extended Hook]
Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Whoever!
Would've thought that a little muthafucker from The Land wouldda came up and made them stacks?
Never was warm in the city, so I had to get on the record and come blaze these tracks
And I'm all around haters everyday, but I guess that's just what fame attracts
But fuck that, where the bucks at?
Man I need that green in my box like Apple Jacks
Matter fact, see me in a ride so foreign you can't understand
6 speed hitting 60, 0 to 3, so come catch me if you can
Speak in ebonics, give a fuck what Mr. Webster said
Let a smart girl read my dick-tionary, I call that ""Ms. Webster head""
Man I gotta get it, when I'm gonna get it, how I gotta get it, and whenever Imma do, I get that
Every moment I want it, cause every day I be grinding
So when you wanna make a move, I'm with that, yeah
Chip off the block
Monster in the booth taking off the lock
And put the shit back on when I'm on the top
So I got the game cuffed up like the cops
And I don't fuck with them
But the Eastside? Yeah, I got love for them
Anybody wanna hate on me, then get on my level, but you will never ever, so I got scrubs for them
Yeah, and I'm from the city where all of the good die young and the old don't make it
So we just hang in in the middle ground
Ready for whatever boy, don't mistake it

Let me take a little sip of the vitamin water and a little bit of the kushie and I'm good
Chillin up in the clouds, wanna fuck my day up?
Man I wish you would
Bitch I'm the man, no longer the kid
Must be the reason why all these grown folks on my dick
Shit, get off my ballsack
Y'all making my drawers sag
Call Saks, walk up in that bitch like 'gimme all dat'
I never had nothing
So what else you think a little kid with a dream gon' do?
Ball without a budget like ""fuck it"" the middle-finger-crew
Real people love me, the jealous try and degrade my name
Y'all must have lost your fuckin melons, boy
I am the game

They shoulda never let me get in the building with a stereo, a pen an' a pad and do damage
Can't nobody ever do it like I do it, since a young'un I been going hard, I'm the baddest

Tatted up no shirt still got sleeves

Still roll through the blocks where they up them thangs
With the same hoes that tatted up my name

Blood, sweat and tears I cried right here
Tatted my city and showed pride right here
Looking at it like 'this mine right here'
So what you talking about; I can’t ride right here?
You mother fuckers think I'm gonna hide right here?
Raised in this god damn city
No I wasn't born in it, but believe I'ma die right here
Cleveland bred, Cleveland fed
My Cleveland girl give me Cleveland head
And anybody saying that Cleveland's dead

Open up my eyes to cold sweat, bloody clothes from my nose
Erhk - Nothing nice
Father, I've killed a man, but I had to do it
Only thing is he is me (Damn!) – how the fuck you couldn’t get me through this?
My skin is blue-ish, voices in my head saying
“Don't be stupid all you have is in that bag you better use it”
Cut it, snuff it, puff it, shoot it
Only one I trust now is myself, these motherfuckers Judas
Gun in my pillow 'cause all I feel is this paranoia
Holes in my wall from all them nights that I was feeling for him
The devil's here (gunshot)
But I'm still awake (gunshot)
Then I broke the mirror (Why?)
'Cause I seen his face
Even my bitch corrupted
I fucked her pussy till it's bloody took it out and then she sucked it, told me that she loved it (Bitch!)

I am a ghost without the bed sheets (Boo!)

I just bought a brand new car, I wanna crash it now
How much darkness did it take to get this flashy now?

So I’m just asking every fan who's questioning my passion
Thinking I'm caught up in fashion or that I forgot my past
To understand that I'm just a dropout, I don't have the answers
I became a dad so young, I ain't know how to use them Pampers
Baby mama's food stamps kept my stomach full
I had to make a plan 'cause now my family needed me to make it rapping
Me and Slim back at that address, 128th, we trapping
Writing lyrics down on napkins
Room so small, we shared a mattress

I guess the drugs are  in my blood, hope I don't pass it down
Hope I'm alive to see my baby get her cap and gown
'Cause doctors told my dad he won’t be here a year from now
Yeah, my first reaction was to punching the wall until it's cracking
Both my knuckles shattered, don't ask what the fuck's the matter
I've been battling the fact I lost my closest to cancer
The only thing she asked was for me and him to get closer
But I hung up too fast, went to sleep in and then she passed
You've been silent seven years, it took that to get us back
We all needed second chances, I've been bottling the sadness
I guess I'm just happy that we finally got to bury shit before the casket

Shining with the stars in the spacious lounge
But I Divorce the ball so I'm on the rebound
Shame a woman’s best friend is a man first child
Coz my weakness for a smile, just reinstated my vows
Matrimony got us walking up the aisle
Me and my guidance agree
In love with the lifestyles

[Hook: IIO & Machine Gun Kelly ]
(I never knew a love)
I never knew a love like this
Power enamblin me, to flourish in my sins
(A love that could be sweeter)
Sweeter then a females lips
Kiss like the diamonds that smile on my wrist
(No matter what my mind says)
Even when my mind says this
My heart keeps pumpin, oh they the hot shit
(Your music gives me feelin')
Pain is for the masses captured
People bring me down, materials uplift

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
(life) what a vacation
Even on my ego trips, no rooms vacant
And tenants giving 10 inches of the hatred
Still not want One foot in my greatness
My statement, I am .prodigy, prophecy
Neo to the matrix, hip hops savior
Outer space patron, married to the game, only stars I’m datin
My love is unconditional but only to the franklins
Councilin don’t ever prevent marriage separation
You can plea my life’s equation
My love couldn’t amount to the songs you gave me
When I wanted out it was you that saved me
Flaunted you for clout now I’m Patrick Swayze
Was a street rat, now an apes and baby
Seen a couple places now for you I’m crazy

I just hung up wit the dope man
He just pulled up in the O van
Piece in my pocket click clack

My tempo is slurred
Twist that hash wit my herb
Mix that soda and syrup
Holdin' my strap like The Purge
Undercovers is the undercovers
Run motherfucker run motherfucker
My homie Tone threw his 45 on the ground
Both got lost and they never get found
Cut through the park stay low, stay low
Hear the pitbulls bark, there they go
I should've went to class this month
But I said fuck that I'm ghost, so
I just rolled up on the dope man
Ay, young gunna, OKAY

Shout out Patty Cake by the way
Told me never put a whole gram in a dime
Give 'em point seven and them fools be fine
But how you gon' sell by the way
You ain't got a clientele by the way
I'ma hit Tri-C wit a couple packs
And if the motherfuckers sellin I'ma double back
Phone ringin more than the operator
And the dealers who deliver gettin all the paper
I spend Sunday trapping on Union
Serving my people like Communion
Can I front 'em a ten? (No)
I am not a friend (No)
Give me money, take this (dope)
Can I get an amen?

Five Heart Beats left
My homie off of Eddie Road
He thinks he’s a damn chef
Everybody schemed out
Don’t nobody wanna work
I was with him last week
Now I got his name on my damn shirt, (R.I.P.)
Everybody pourin’ liquor
My partner out he beat a case
Took a piss on the fed building
Told them motherfuckers free Chase!
Them boys in the rear view
So now I’m going 25
If they catch my homie in the shot gun, ridin’ with a shot gun
They gon’ give him twenty-five
I’m tryna be responsible
I know they heard I got a deal
They shot the dice game up for five dollars
What they fuck you think they doin’ for a couple mill?
I gotta keep my eyes open
But this weed got me feelin’ heavy
Just like the pistol in my pants
Hate to have it but these mufuckas petty

(In my hood)
All my mufuckas ready
I be rollin’ presidential like Teddy
I might hit the strip club and break a fuckin’ levy
In honor of every hustler that’s locked up in a celly
Fuck it, I might buy the Q Arena for a week and sell it out
Fuck it, I might buy a kilo for the hood and fix the drought
Fuck it, I’ma hold the city on my back when y’all don’t
Come to Cleveland I can get you what you want

Rappers aren't doin’ shows
Man half them mufuckas hoes (true)
If you got a problem call me
In the land I am big bro
Young man, but I’m standin’ at 6’4”
And SixFo, that’s my man from the east coast
Midwest muthafuckas known to hold dope
85 state side, ATL knows

It’s clucks at the bus stop
Our billboards got mugshots
Top ten most wanted
And streets where them houses look haunted, (bando)

"[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I'm humble because I know what it feels like to be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me...
I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around, now I'm somebody

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get a heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me 'cause I'm nothing like them, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he's proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated (Rrr)
When inspiration, motivation was needed (Rrr)
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'm a keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli' sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listenin' to Witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirling
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""

[Verse 2: Twista]
Twista, I remember thinking I would rather die
Then go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I'm ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs, everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back and forth on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y'all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimping on everybody
And certain mothafuckers that want to get in my circle I tell them naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy, naturally
And I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s ""Fuck them"", I don’t even bother
And who knows what's next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Midwest, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in, better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level, wherever you wanna go
Everybody put they hands up, I'm ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up, yeah

And when everybody’s hot, I'm past heat
And if I don't need the fuel, don't gas me (Yeah)
It's been a long time coming since 100 Words And Running
Mothafucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then you know we gotta have it
Don’t anybody ever snitch, get pinched, you forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget (Blah)
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby's mother
Never gonna know his daddy, tragic
Why's the government gotta lie to get money? (Huh?)
Why's the federal reserve gotta take from me? (Why?)
Why should I be fighting for another country?
Have you seen my city mothafucka? We hungry! (Urghh)
Representing for the middle of the map even though me and mine are coming from the bottom (Waddup)
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
You really think that Notorious B.I.G would believe these guys? (Nope)
All these internet thugs that the media finds?
You wanna talk about grind?
Look at me in the encyclopedia, what name is in it?
I bet you see mine, motherfucker that's Kells
Skinny boy, six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still, I came out on T-O-P
So this is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had to him was some headphones
So he pick a song, and he turn 'em on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape and the kick in the bass
That's the story of MGK

Thats why I’m always looking out for the little things
You should never be ashamed of a little fame

Y’all know what it's like when them lights go off in the condo
Need a break from the bullshit pronto
Spend your last check on a trip to Chicago
And see your favorite band on the stage again
In your favorite shirt that you made for them
They play the song and you sang with them
Because music heals the soul
And that moment's there so take it in

All that glitters ain't gold
But I really wanna shine right now
And they told me the the sky's the limit
So I wonder if I can fly right now
Yeah, so I spread my wings
Jumped up and lived my dreams
I used to always say that I'd be fly
Now I got my head high
In the sky where the airplanes be
And now I'm reachin' up for the stars
Almost there
Told me I was dreamin' too big
I almost care
Till I hopped in my spaceship
And left the matrix
To a place where theres no more air
And now I go to sleep
Wherever they wanna be
Openin' my eyes seein' what they wanna see
And I never aged one year
Still a grown ass kid
You could never tell me what I'm gonna be
Cuz I might wake up
And wanna be king
And see the president
And wanna be the same thing
Or maybe be a pilot
And buy my own island
With a million dollars that I earned last spring
And of course
You know I'd have the worlds prettiest girl
Waitin' for me when I go away
And when I get back
Ima kiss her like the very first time
And take her to the malls and say
I want it all

See a star shoot past make a wish hope it comes tonight
But until then
Pack my bags put my headphones on
So everything can turn into a dream
And reality seems like I ain't been outta my bed in so long
I just wanna fly so high
And escape the real
Into a world that is all made up
So turn my alarm clock off
And lock the door
I wanna sleep until I can't wake up
Now with that being said
Bring me all the girls in the world
In a pool in my penthouse suite
And open up the shades
Get a view of the world
Out a window up 85,000 feet
And then we jump
Lava lamps floatin' around us
I guess gravity never found us
They always said whatever you do remain grounded
But Ive always been in the clouds my worlds groundless
So we go up, up, up we gone
And I dont wanna come back down
So ima do whatever whenever however that I gotta do it
To feel like I do right now
Cuz every days good
Every nights great
Yesterdays lobster
Tonight its steak
Spendin' my whole life
Lookin' for my place
Im a star
Shoulda known that it was up in space
We all came out of the womb cryin'

They don't remember riches, they just remember the name
Kells...

Now go and get it homie
One thing for sure I know the block ain't gonna get it for me
Two thing's for certain, I ain't tryna let em pidgeon toe
And if they is just know I'm walking with my pistol on me
This ain't that B shit or C shit, this is that D-o-r-D shit
That means Do or Die, cause ain't no you, if it's you and I
I ain't no gangster but I will be just to stay alive
I'm rollin' indica, staying high
Roll to the cinema and stay the night
My life's like TV with this daytime drama
All this Law and Order, a lot of comedy
And relationships like Tina and Ike, these bitches crazy
That's why I'm tellin' ya
Look up to the stars instead of staring at a cellular
You could be the greatest why would you wanna be regular?
Just know that your greatness comes from how they gon' remember ya
Not from how you spend baby, that isn't it baby
Man we ain't gotta have a condo or a crib baby
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don't remember riches, they just remember the name...

Rose from the ashes like a Phoenix
Rose feelin', rose feelin' up in the marinas
Got my weight up in my hood we call that triple-beamin'
Fuck introductions, skip the name and just call me Cleveland
Homie callin' for bail, tryna get out the precinct
Tellin' me give 'em hell, funny I started preaching
And when I say I got us bet the city gon' believe 'em
Cause everybody left us and they know I'm never leaving
So I turn it up one time for the days runnin' on the corner
Talkin' shit and getting lit from sippin' brews in Arizona
And when one time came through everybody gone except for me
I couldn't leave, I am the loner, with the mind of a stoner
And dreams of putting this game in a choker
And fuckin' until she pay me like Oprah
I'm not a hoper, I'm a knower of what's in the forecast like Al Roker
So even if it pours, I am Noah, two oars
Two rowers, row us to two shores
I found promise land, now we lying on two floors
One for the fam, the other for two whores, shit
Fuck two minutes, I did this in two chords, of course
I'm too versatile for a chorus
I've done too many tours to be a tourist
Fuck the magazine, I am the Source
I am too boss to be employed, more stories about your boy than Chuck Norris
Man, listen up

All I know, all I know
I am from the city where the grass don't grow
I am from the city in the middle of the map
Where half these motherfuckers that rap don't go
All I know, all I know
If I throw this cash then her ass gets low
But I am from the city where the cash don't flow
So I keep it for myself and I smash that ho
Smash that ho, smash that ho
Treat her like a bop it and I pass that ho
But I ain't saying nothing that my fans don't know
I'm an EST boy till the casket close
Six foot deep, six foot three
Eight motherfuckers in the SUV
Eight new states in a seven day week
Whole world laced up like some brand new sneaks
And they know I'm gonna raise till I'm face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn these EST boy's done came up

I just spent too many minutes watchin' little videos of shitty wannabe rappers dissing me
I just spent the winter livin' after someone tried to send a kill shot, missin' me
Young blonde Don and the double-X mob got a gang out in Sicily
Why you think they call me the Gunner?
I'm poppin' off on anybody if they trigger me

[Verse 1]
Black and yellow jacket on like I'm Kill Bill
Grew up scrappin' and I still will
We can take it back to 2012
I was trappin' on the tour bus with Meek Mill
Take it back to Cleveland, when they gave Chase 17 years, no plea deal
2014 when the people tried to rob me in the lobby
I bet they can feel the feet still
Point out my enemies soon as they mention me
Call an assembly, pick up a pen and put you out your misery
Written in history, it was gonna happen eventually
I just can't wait 'til the day that I run into you physically
For everything that I went through mentally
When it felt like everybody in the world was against me
When all the critics and every article tried to offend me
My daughter slapped a kid for talkin' 'bout me in elementary
We ain't playin', it's deeper than the fame
People gettin' checked for disrespectin' the family name
Two chopsticks, no lo mein
Hollow tips, got no name
Bust them shits with no aim
Like it's Bird Box
But the blindfold is a black flag this time to cover my face
The dash cam just saw me killin' everybody

[Chorus]
I got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf
I chop my coke on hotel keys
I chopped his face like Constantine
Constantly get déjà vu
I see me when I look at you
I never die, I multiply
So don't cry at my funeral

What would this generation of hip-hop be
Without me here to piss y'all off?
I see the blogs, I read the comments
I'm confused, I need to pause
Look at y'all waitin' on me to fall off
While I'm lookin' at y'all from a suite in the Waldorf
I sold 40 million records, I ain't even 30
Give me 20 seconds, I'll list 10 movies that I've been in
One legend that tried to fuck with me and then got the venom
One publication that said that I would never be in it
One agent that told me without her, my career is finished
And I couldn't give a single fuck inside my cerebellum
Y'all award shows suck, go tell 'em
We ain't suckin' no dick in the 216
Brought O's to the land like Beckham
On the 13th floor with a weapon
I heard that they coming, yeah, let 'em in
I got somethin' for 'em, yeah, please forgive my sins
Blood on my Ralph Lauren, yeah, I can't wash this shit
Wake up, say, ""Good morning,"" yeah, like I forgot

Got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf

Holla though, Haters n' the foes need to stop it
I will hit that bitch, pass her 'round the room like a bop-it
Back to the topic, and in case you forgot it
I was all about my dick, and how you haters jock it
F him, F him, She's ight, F You
And if you forgot procedure lemme show you what to do:
Make sure you keep four fingers down, keep one up
Say if you ain't talking about more money please shut up
Me, I'm on the come up, I don't know what you 'bout
One million, two million, let me know how you count
And I'm nominated as youngin' of the year
Red Rover, Red Rover, bring that money over here
And steer, and make sure I remain in my lane
But that's symbolic cause I'm really on a plane
Look, and I Red Rover, that's ironic, because I don't play no games
I don't pass or rock like J
I ain't messing with you lames
Hold on, uh
Said I don't pass or rock like J
Cause I ain't with you dames

Excuse my back trick, need no practice
Cause I spit crack like Nino rapped this
And I'm a star in the galactic
Being forward with the kid the wrong way
Or get your head spun backwards
Open cans of whoop-ass like I unpacked it
I've been patient all week and now I feast on savage
And eat each haters heads up like cabbage
To eternally bind them in my stomach like marriage
This fairy needs medical, call up the horse and carriage
We don't, dig this, grab a shovel get buried
If I don't get my respect i will, cut your family
Cut you mother, Cut your sister, more importantly your daddy
Should run up but he ain't half the man
You bitches this is literal lyrical combat, get stitches

Where were you when I was down, I got questions
Now, it's all these hoes in the lounge at the Westin
I just met somebody’s parents, left a bad impression
They smelled a package that I just picked up from the reception
Hey, fuck 'em, I'm stressin', I don’t learn my lesson
Customs locked me down in LAX for coke possession
Just had a publicist that left, said I was too aggressive
Then had a ex that couldn’t stand me 'cause I'm not possessive
Impressive, haha, I just want to say
I ditched the VMAs and went back up the way, ayy
From the ghetto to a rock god, hit 'em up like 'Pac
Let's just keep it G
Only Eazy I fuck with is E (damn)
I seen he dyed his hair and got a hanging earring
I fucked his girl, now he look like me, this shit overbearing
How dare him, I dare him
Don’t think about comparing
Man turn that frat rap off, I’m getting sick of hearing
I’m in LA, at my spot, right next door to Terrence
I’m knocking on the door next time I see Kanye’s McLaren
Like, I need beats (ayy)
Like, hook me up with Kendall
Man, all the masses out in Calabasas got me mental
Bitch, I’m a dog, yeah, I came up out the kennel
And that teardrop on my partner eye ain't cause he's sentimental
Look, I told you, I told you that I’m coming (yeah)
They should've left me doing pop, y’all don’t want me gunnin'
My daughter's with me, ain’t no school yet, it’s the end of summer
So close your ears, your daddy’s bout to kill these motherfuckers
Lyrically, I’m 6 feet I'm
23 MJ on the beat I'm
Stronger, faster by design
I’m a Lambo, you’re a Nissan
I’m the big bad wolf, no peace sign
Gonna give these fans their tea time
I would tell their man’s he’d be fine, but then I’d be lying
I’m mobbing in that all-black Range
With a long list of names, duct taped, y’all ain't safe (ugh)
Clinically, I’m insane
Industry is full of lames
Gone when the cops came (ugh)
Paper planes (ugh) sugar cane (ugh)
To the brain, bottle drained, numb the pain (ugh)
I’m just saying (ugh) I’m ashamed (ugh)
I paved this lane and they don’t even say my name
Yeah, I’m white, yeah, I’m rock and roll, yeah, I got soul
Yeah, my daughters black, yeah, I love to rap, yeah, I’m fighting back
Yeah, I hate the fame, wish I had a mask
Yeah, I got pulled over with my stylist, had no license, and a strap
Plead the fifth, that ain’t Saks (ayy)
Speak some facts (ayy)
All you dummies love money, do some math
Seven digits in my 20’s (yuh)
A misfit, fuck the critics, everyone of yah
I used to burn a Fader magazine in public (yah)
Just 'cause one journalist, a hater, and a sucker (yah)
High school reunion on my calendar, you know I’m ready
I’m leaving tour just to show up, you now I’m fucking petty
I ain’t forget none of you pussies and the rest of y’all been playing too long
Let's take it back to Vegas on my 22nd at the Palms
Got a call, my life was being threatened by a pimp
He ain’t know I’m in the room with 20 goons and J. Prince
Now, I’m pissed
Y’all done made me talk my shit
I was chillin', now I’m back to being a villain in this bitch

I'm so God damn gone I don't know where home is
Feeling real sauced up no boneless
I keep it G, fuck keeping up with the Joneses
Smelling so funky that you would think that I was homeless
And the fans like, Kells stop playing with him
That girl's man like, bitch stop laying with him
And the haters on the internet tryna' be thugged out
But them dealers and killers man I was staying with 'em
Eastside Cleveland to the death yo
Fuck LeBron, the Kid never left y'all
Forget the number twenty-three man it's EST
You see it tatted on my chest, we the best y'all
Couple stacks if you wanna get a verse from me
Make a diss track if you wanna get a hearse from me
I got the gift already so I fuck bitch ass dick shit if you wanna get the curse from me
Cause everybody be wanting something that I got
Leaning on me like a tripod
But I'm already leaning up with the liquor
They be running up like do or die guy, Kells on their iPod
And I'm fucking with these trees real heavy man, real real heavy man
Blowing up brown good, the shit's real pettigrand
Mix it with the red I be calling that shit spaghetti
I'll be all up in the mountains blowing on that white yeti, man
End of the day I'll be chilling man, what's new
I'm for the people not the rappers man, fuck dude
I'd rather be a lame than rely on a name
Or rock sunglasses in the dark man, fuck cool
And the album coming soon y'all bear with me
Laced up, Chuck T's brought a pair with me
Hit 123rd for the sour Dies
Though I'm blunted in the car looking like a flare's with me
The people here with me hold me down, all dogs homie, no meow
That's why my circle as small as a penny cause ain't no-one sold me out
But funny how everyone knows me now
And before all this we had the streets on lock, man, Dub knows
Ask Ash what it was 'fore we book shows
Me and Slim in a 1 bedroom, no money no food but now we eating good though
Now I could go (Where?)
Anywhere up there, all I gotta do is push go
Give me the green light meaning give me good 'dro
From a land far far away where the wood grow
And I'm staying real throwed like a pitch
Cop a whole zip put it in a dish
Blowing something real real evil so I call this witch
You got dirt so I call that ditch, you bitch

[Verse 2]
The dope boys feel me, the suburbs feel me
Your girl definitely does, cause she here with me
So really you don't have a choice but to deal with me
And you like my shit, keep it real with me
Matter of fact, let's keep this one hundred
If I was pocket change I would be one hundred
You would be a nickel, even when I'm nothing
I was still a two fifties equalling out to one hundred
So keep it one hundred, Kells is that boy
Who resuscitated the city dog, that boy
Who got a whole coast behind him, that boy
So if you want the real, listen to that boy
And I'm that boy, 20 years old
With the world on my shoulder like a fur coat
Used to be square now I'm in a circle
Sipping Merlot, for real man? for sure
So about it you'd think I was from No Limit
Real white boy rap, dog, no gimmick
Bringing the game back to life with no clinic
Because I let 'em see the real me, no tinted
So I'm in this, the new face of

So I can show these people how to dream, right
I could show 'em how to aim for the stars
And take it to the arenas from the street lights
Damn, oh this is what the top feels like? (Whoa)
I still remember Ramen noodle meal nights
I still remember checkin' my account
And having 26 dollars when I signed my record deal nights
And I remember being cold
In my apartment, used the heater from the kitchen stove
Highs and Lows, that's how it goes
So I gotta roll somethin' up
Just to cope with the pressures of growin' up, man

What a week
We made it to the bar 'cause we need to heal up
You gotta play for keeps
'Cause Aces tend to stay with dealers

For everytime they told me what I wouldn't be
I would be a rich man with a crib on a big hill (for real)
But I gotta work to get paid
Earn my own way
Work the third shift, burn the whole spliff
Since birth I've been... (Hold up, let me get it)
Look, failure was not an option, I gotta be at the top
Like I'm sorry, but I don't really feel sorry for y'all
I'm sorry I got a new number that you can't call
I'm sorry to everyone who still wants me to fall
Hold up, you know what, I ain't sorry at all

So I, hope that it was worth it when you searching
And you find what glitters ain't gold
And I, knew I wasn't perfect but I know that I made it all on my own

Bought the yayo from Miguel, though

Came from public education

Went from stealing out of Walmart to president of operations

Why would you ever come from nothing
And not do whatever the fuck you wanted?

I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

[Verse 1: MGK]
Looking down at my phone, see another missed call
I'm pissed off, I never had these problems back when I was piss poor
Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared to look at something so precious when I'm a mess
And her mother know it, I wonder if she ever regrets
Tryna convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
Cause people hated on me, how could I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?
Imagine having to make that decision
While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping
Wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?
Phone's ringing... ""Aye, yo, I'm with my child""
Anyways, I wanna write you a symphony
But instead she said all I ever wanted is you to stay a while, damn

And hey, hey, hey
It's been so long so you've gone away

[Verse 2: MGK]
Five years to be more specific
I was out here trying to sign to Atlantic
You crossed the Pacific
Now is it a coincidence that my first instrument was a violin
That my father wanted for me, so we ended up buying
And now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high in it
And while I'm writing my first verse he called me up crying?
That shit is crazy, half a decade with no explanation
Now you're asking if it's too late to save us
Man, I don't know so I hang up without saying nothing, just click end
Wasn't man enough to say it so I wrote with a pen
I just wanted to make you happy, but you never smiled
I just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
Anyways, maybe eventually we'll relive memories
And you'll be next to me and both of us can stay a while, yeah

"[VERSE 1]
Congratulations, welcome to your new life's orientation!
They wonder why they call you baby
When you're head to toe with tattoo abrasions
Maybe it's cause I'm in the crib
Louie rag ??? conceals my outfit
And when I want, I want real big
And I'm not afraid to scream like Jeezy ad-libs
They like, ""Okay it's time to hit the road Jack""
Fresh air in me, feeling like cognac
A new bounce in me, guess I got the toad back
Waving goodbye, knowing that I'll never go back

Good morning, I gotta wash the sleep up out my eyes
Good morning, I gotta get fresh before I step outside
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning, goodbye

Attention, class in session
Hit the corner store to grab my snack concessions
Cause I, know that I ain't gonna read too much
Raised on a grain of salt, I don't need too much
But I, must day dream, I must stay clean
??? the soap bar I used this morning
New hood, new walk, new face
Sick of all the old miles I ran in old lace
Instead I threw on my Chucks and strolled
Waved to the sun with my top down and rolled
Pockets bowed, outta my Artful Dodgers
Good day, I'm the neighborhoods Mr. Rogers
Now I'm not against the world
Been long enough now I'm finally by my girl
Finally by my dawgs, right beside my team
Good morning real world, I'm outside my dream

So out of place with all these fake people in my face

Like I create, and they just take everything  I make

Run run, fuck the law

Running from the old and senile
Follow in my steps, then you walking a green mile
Cause trees in my pockets like my denims a greenhouse

So what I really wanted all along's been camouflaged fatigued

Now I think leaving is the one thing I regret
Cause the one thing I possess
It wasn't materials, wasn't checks, wasn't cars, wasn't clothes, or any part of success
It was you, and without that in my life I'm depressed
You became the new drug I couldn't get
And every time you came over I was on some shit
Either too fucked up, or bitching about how you dress
Even though I remember when you would lay with me when I ain't have a bed
Buy me food and come wake me up with some head
You had me like a dread - locked down, but I wouldn't show it
Instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind

Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up, you hit it
And we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
And fuck these other bitches, baby, fuck these other bitches in my bunk
Staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday
Remember that? Cause I couldn't forget it
Like I forgot yours, but I'm sorry and I said it
I admit it, I fucked up and I lied, but this is true
I don't know what home is because I'm lost without you

"[Verse 1]
Am I wrong for being lost?
The pressures of being boss exhausted every bone in my body
I can't walk
I don’t talk, I scream, I don't stop to think
I'm so close to the dream that I can’t go to sleep
Ironic, I know, so I need more chronic to roll
Tryna find what's more important, the money or my soul
It's cold, I'm low, I'm caught between the roads
Under the Hollywood sign, you get blinded by the glow, uh
Yo, how could you look me in the face?
You sat at the table with my daughter promising you got us
Right after you finished saying grace
Why don't you tell her what you're hiding in the bank?
It's time to cut my lawn to see the snakes
It’s time to tell the truth to every fan who doesn’t understand
That it's because of you they had to wait
While you left me here to deal with all the hate
I still smile, but feel so fake
It’s no sun, the clouds are opaque
So much shade I read on one page
I can't even look at your name without getting the shakes
What a mistake, uh, look how you take, uh
What doesn't belong to you, this was a rape
And if fate send us both to Heaven
I'ma keep a blade in my leather so I can kill you at the gate, uh

Is it worth it when you see it’s all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)

I woke up sweatin', tryna forget I'm in a mansion
'Cause fans are mad at my expansion
And my friend I thought was family
Who'd always understand me
Got offended 'cause he jealous
We supposed to be at the GRAMMYs
I'm asking, when did pride and passion
Get mistaken for handouts and ass-kissing?
The fact is I made it from trailer trash to Saks 5th
Took it from underground to massive, and the come up was classic
Back when white boys rapped, they gettin' their ass kicked
I was battlin', putting these rappers in caskets
I was walking home, getting jumped after classes
Tell me why don't my haters mention that shit?
Now my rent is due and I'm a tenant getting by with no credit
Got residue from a sedative I ain't get from the medic
My schedule is so fuckin' hectic, but still I'm in debt
I'd be better off dead so life insurance keep my family fed
It's because of y'all, I couldn't separate from my career
Because of y'all, I hated myself for so many years
Because of you, you ain't never gonna see me trust
Even if I got a wife, she just somebody I fuck

It's been a long time coming, but I'm finally home
They used to call me kid, that boy is finally grown
Came from the rock bottom, look at how far I've come
Couldn't wait for the day to say father, look at your son
Took what was impossible and turned it to a dream
Until I lost so much sleep it became reality
They say that what goes up, must come down
I'm that ashy, that classy, poster child
So I roll out my red carpet, break out my red garments
Haters wanting my dead, break out my red target
They question what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything

[Chorus]
They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits
Reputation matches my attire, I'm authentic
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em its my homecoming

[VERSE 2]
I have outgrew so many things, the hood does not fit me
But I can't forget my past, I brought the whole hood with me
Because I love my city, it made me who I am
Tattoo read city boy, but I'm the city's man
You'll never break me down, they wish I was afraid
Out of all the situations I've fought for, you'd think I'd run away?
??? a thousand depths and I ain't hurt yet
Taught how to be a man, but to be a sucka, I ain't learnt yet
So everybody put your drinks up, let's toast to who didn't need no help
Now swing one back for anybody who got one they goddamn selves
I bring it back for the city and they put on for me
We celebrating the beginning, this my homecoming

They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything

This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming, tell 'em it's my homecoming

[VERSE 3]
I told 'em what I wanted, what I meant this what I need
It's not just I, it's everyone that's depending on me
I pour my heart in these beats to soar up outta these streets
Pour victory bottles till liquor knocks us out on these sheets
I say it straight faced, I feel it's owed to me
Monopolize like Rockerfeller, that's the HOV in me
My father couldn't even influence my ways
So why the fly-fuck you think I care what a haters gotta say?
I know exactly why they hate, they know exactly why I'm great
They put in work and I work harder, they follow I innovate, YES
I never claimed the title, I was given the throne
Cleveland's American Idol, the king is finally home

They asked me what I've started, I tell 'em several things
They asked me what I wanted, I tell 'em everything
My heart is all in it, losing is off limits

They told me to write a soundtrack 
For the kids who ain't have shit 
No problem, flashback me 2006 
Broke as piss, scraping bus fare up
Dolla fifty cents, get out of school and go to work
Matter fact fuck all this I quit
I got a dream that we gon change the world soon 
And one day get the fuck outta this bedroom
Maybe write a song for the girl who cries when she thinks of her past
But just press play, I tell her smile and then she laughs, look at that, yeah
Music makes the world go round 
And the ones in search of freedom generates into a crowd 
All it takes is one believer with a voice to introduce us to what’s real
And since my throat is clear I guess that’s why I’m here
Chyeah 
See my teachers told me go away to college
But what they don’t tell you is ain't no guarantees if you’re a scholar 
Even with 18 degrees, you could be jobless with Uncle Sam in your pockets
So I said fuck my doctrines
Rapped and made more money than these doctors

And I’m like what we waiting round for
Found something to celebrate now we on round four 
Ground floor was the past now the sky is the limit penthouse edition 
Exhibit a: a bunch of young muhfuckas livin 
I used to hustle to get it
Used up all of my minutes 
In hopes of one of my ex's telling me she owned a business and heard bout my situation here’s a check for a million 
But this is reality and charity don’t go to sinners 
But clarity comes in pinners of marijuana and splinters 
An absentee in attendance at all my high school events 
I just wasn’t fond of attention when all I had was resentment 
I started out as a freshman and graduated a henchman 
I worked my way up to Jimmy 
Worked my way up the totem 
And those who hated on me was just adding weight to my scrotum
See life is a poker game I got the hand now I ain't folding
I’m King Midas touch my future with this hand now that shits golden, whoo
One day ill be too fly whippin three girls in my four door while these five J's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch I’m Frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo, man I swear to God

Everything I write is being played out, like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall
But they don't know the past
Even if I told 'em it all
They wouldn't know the half
So maybe I'll fill up my luggage with all of these dreams
And put on my black coat and my black chucks
And nothing in my jeans
And just run, til the day comes like Rocky's movie scene
And lay up on the top of the world, look up and scream
Like this is me, this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city, but clearly I never failed
Lost myself in the game, but I found myself in the cell
Then I found myself in the fame, and lost myself in the pills
And they can not mess with me still
See the boys, and they winning, underdogs of the year

I'd rather limp than be a wimp and spend my ends up on a bitch that crimp
Gamers in my sport so I ain't never had to pitch, get it
Get a clip and put a tip into your baby momma's hip
Because my clique do the dirty work and I collect the chips
I'm 'bout more money, what's a hater though
I'm focused on more whips, I ain't a faggot
Tell them dudes to get they lips up off my dick, bitch

[Outro]
By God, I've done it again there Johnson
Hey, nah man this is for all my Cleveland people out there
Doing their thing man
Keep grinding, let's get it
Once again, it is your favorite white boy rapper
I am Machine Gun Kelly bitch
I be wildin' bitch
I be wildin' mother fucker",Machine Gun Kelly,International Haters Anthem,
"[Verse 1: MGK]
Yea Cleveland on my back uh
L's up when they see me
Came from the underground now they on t.v
Swear to god ha
Ooh Machine Gun Kells, dub-o
Look look you can miss me with that rap shit
You can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn't lyrical""
Barbershop chat shit
Miss me with that frat shit
Only university i graduated
Was hard Knox
I'm from  Cleveland
Where they trap shit
Five bucks for the catfish
Five bucks for the  bad bitch
Five bucks in a drought in this city could get ya piece of that cactus
With saran wrap for the wrapping
Whatchu mean?
Meaning we bundling all of this loud into Garcia Vegas
I swear its contagious the way that we passed it
Patches on my denim vest
About as old as my dad is
Blood stains on my chucks
Cause well you know what that is
Jet lag from these long flights
Still sitting coach like its practice
Feeling like students when the schools back I’m trying to see what first class is
Cash is the root of all evil
But maybe that why i do bad shit
Fact is i do what we need cause the country
And no Catholic or Baptist
Warlord or pacifist,could've seen what I seen without
IMAX's and 3D glasses
Yall in family houses like Bob Saget
Both parents i was on family couches
Like you don't want it i'll wear it
Inheriting hammy downs as a grown man embarrassed but
These dreams seemed far fetched
When reality is you’re sharing a shirt
And a shower, and shitter while your newborns in the carriage
Packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average
This ain't living this is strife
This is Hennessy and this is just sprite
But Maybe one day they'll remember me like they remember Mike
When I'm gone
Mother fucker, god dammit ""that's what I'm talking about
Maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
""what else?""
I ain't done
Look when my times up on this earth
And they bury me in that dirt
Don't say that i ain't milk this life
For everything that it's worth
{yuhck}
For everything that its worth
And when i die remember me like Kurt
..BANG!

[Verse 2: Dub-O]
Look they said Dub quit with that humble shit
You can only be cool for so long
But don't misjudge I'm not
The one you wanna rumble with
Write it down take a pic
Do what ever you have to do to remember me
I'm in your memory for infinity
And the same goes for your bitch
Remember me from Kennedy
Or east high on the east side
Were them niggas die over anything
Yeah, dub-o
Oh you ain't know
I got go i rock shows
And i'll be calling plays like flaco
But I'm so Cleveland
It's a damn shame
And est is my damn game
I've been reppin that
Since way back
And that double x is my campaign
Pop bottles that champagne
Its Cliquot for the champions
Now where the hell is my damn ring?
Biatch, celebration for nothing let you believe what you see
I’m in the back but no frontin
Seven days out the week i be working
I'm full of hunger
That jealousy is the smell of defeat
And remember who told ya
I'm gone ""motherfucker""
Just remember me when I'm gone
Dub-o eh
When that times up on my watch
And they bury me in that box
Don't say i ain't give my gang
Everything that i got ""real shit"" yea
Everything that i got
And when i die remember me
Like PAC BABAYY

"[Chorus: Ester Dean]
Voices in the air
I hear them loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

[Verse 1: MGK]
As my, world turns
The heart beats
Not only in my chest
But the heart in these streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre beats
I am from the city of evil, came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, whats up?
Inception shows me as a dead man walkin', but reflections shows this kid's still got it
Let it be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being
And anyone under my level that’s coming at my spot for the top
Let them have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

[Chorus]
I hear voices in the air
I hear em’ loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh I am

[Verse 2]
Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged down
Everything I write is played out like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall but they don’t know the path
Even if I told them it all, they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all of these dreams and put on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
And just run, till the day comes like Rocky’s movie scene
And I’m on top of the world, look up and scream like this is me, this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself in the game when I found myself in a cell
Then I found myself in the fame when I lost myself in the pills
And you cannot mess with me still , seen them boys and they winnin
Underdogs of the year, Cleveland boys in the buildin'
What the fuck is a ceiling I’m taking this to the top, and when I leave the whole world drops Lace Up Kells

[Chorus]
I hear voices in the air
I hear em’ loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh I am…..",Machine Gun Kelly,Invincible,Ester Dean

"[Verse 1]
See I've been searchin' for somethin' out there
When is it comin'? Tell me
What to tell myself
When I drink so much that it hurts my health
'Cause I stay up way too late
And I owe a million favors
I can't overstress myself
So I wrote it down to express myself
I'm lookin' in the mirror tryna find
Peace of mind in a piece of my
Inspiration back from the beginning
Life's a movie, I can't make revisions
Ate an eighth of shrooms and started trippin'
Had some visions that were nonexistent
I think I just left the solar system
Doesn't matter, I still kept the rhythm
Diamonds still gon' light up like a prism
That's from years of grindin' independent
What was at the bottom now has risen
If this isn't Heaven then what is it?
Always real but never realistic
Want the world but nothin' in specific
Don't need shootin' stars to grant my wishes
I'm a superstar, let's go and get it

[Chorus]
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky
Kiss the sky-y-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 2]
Now can I, lay underneath you?
While they play all the previews
And I'll pretend like I'm restin'
Maybe you'll skip to the end and
Pass all the irrational decisions
Patch up all the passion that was missin'
I think that's enough, I'm feelin' lovesick
Rollin' loud, I'm on some turnin' up shit
Paid a couple hundred for a high that I couldn't get on my own (on my own)
And I've been lookin' for a long time, but I never found home
Everything is alright, I'm around for the long ride
Go get drunk and find some trouble (ayy)
Add some pieces to the puzzle (ayy)
Couple rights, couple wrongs
That's the prequel to the sequel (yeah)
And all the space in between us
Are memories that we conceal
The jagged edges of a pill
Remember what it is to feel
Windows down behind the wheel
Gotta do it for the thrill, watch me

Smokin' hash, now my hashtag's ""pass that!"" and I never need cash back
My green is on the credit of the fact that I'm the muthafuckin' man, jack
Coming straight out of the land where them Cavs at
Good stock of tree to take me I get higher than the NASDAQ
Burn somethin', me and my friends fried
Spicy chicken sandwich, some burgers and French fries
And my cherry slushie, that's red as my friend's eyes
So goddamn high I fell asleep in my friend's ride, shit
I'm fucked up, but these the days I live fo'

We got them swishers, king size Zig Zags and all utensils
OG kush big bags, edibles in the kitchen
Plus the air match the smoke around my tattoo'd initials
So fire up the muthafuckin' bong like its a missile
Where the bitches? Somebody call the cell
Tell em bring the liquor, some mixers, and high heels
I'm half naked and all these ladies is as well
And you would be if you burn like we burnin', I'm hot as hell
Shells stuffed with the finest product these dealers sell
I swear we done ran thru more papers this summer then the mail
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, let's get by

Eighteen burgers total
Let me get, let me get five of the circus fries

Three of them just put one French fry in there but put the same amount of sauce as if all of the French fries were in there (That is retarded, are you high?)

Gone fragile?
Was it above the man?
In wonder, steady going under...

Tell them drain the pool I’m sinking fast
Come and save my life before it pass
Scratching at the surface but the bottom’s where I’m at
Only place my addiction will tell me that I’m free at last
So why the fuck you playing with my head? I said I’m done
Any and everything I had is gone I said you won
You promised that we’d only be together for a minute then we finish
But my life is passed another year why the fuck is you in it
Bitch I gave up everything for you even my house
Now I’m begging on a nightly basis to sleep on the couch
My counselor said I need to find a way to block the pain
I told him it was already too late she is in my veins and he said

Tell me what led you on, I’d love to know...

Well, it’s just that, when I felt her the first time I flew
Nobody gives me the high that she do
See, we fight all the time and she leaves bruises on my arms
But the way she makes me feel inside that girl can do no wrong
Now all my family hates me since I started fuckin with her
And all my friends done left me cause they jealous that I’m wit her

This is just a real song, you know
MGK, Rock City Let's Go!

[Hook: Rock City]
They said I been wrong for way too long, I wish they would leave me alone
They said I ain't strong and I can't hold on, I wish they would leave me alone
He said, she said, that I'm wanted by the law, I wish they would leave me alone
And ain't no wanted man gonna get too far, I wish they would leave me alone

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I never would've thought as a kid dreaming to record
That I would've went through more ups and downs that a seesaw
But this a grown man's world so you need balls
Million and one problems, the fuck you bitching at me for?
Bruh, but what you eat doesn't make me shit
So no matter what I'mma make these hits
Cause hating on you couldn't make me rich
So I gotta, gotta go get that dollar and the fifteen cents
For the profit don't equal the rent
Shit, I'm a father, I gotta feed my kids
And I wish that I could say I had 15 friends
Who happy to see my success and don't want a piece of my ends
Cause what they don't understand is I'm struggling just like them
I just pray that my story is gon' be happy in the end

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
And I pray for happiness in these sad times
Hope someday my life will bubble like it's bath time
What else? Maybe somewhere countin' numbers like it's math time
So I gotta grind, no breaks, fuck halftime
I've had a job since fourteen
Pushing carts, fast food, scrubbing floors, yeah I done the whole thing
But I was fed up, couldn't just work for anybody
And I guess it's true what they say, school's not for everybody
I'm just a dropout, nineteen with no hope
But my notebook front to back is full of big dreams of SoHo
And I don't know, how to answer my girl when she ask
When you gonna work and leave this music in the past?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
If it is what I ask for, a little money in my pocket and a passport
But I never knew that it would come at the price
Of a hundred people hatin on me, now I gotta wear a mask or
Just fast forward, cause the internet thug in this city wanna see you fail
But if you rewind, know I've been through hell
So no matter what I will prevail
So my father or my daughter or myself and all my team
And these labels couldn't change me either, not one thing
See the streets want me to thug, and corporate America thinks I'm priceless
If I remove the curse and live my life like Miley Cyrus
But I'm none of that, fuck that, the money couldn't change me
Still the underdog, still the kid, it's the same me
Came from the bottom on my own
And I did it as MGK, fuck off and leave me alone
I'm gone

Kells, to my fans
Hold me down mo'fucka
And that's all I say

[Verse 1 - Machine Gun Kelly]
When that crowd leave will you stay for me?
And if I don't become what they thought I was
In the time I should and my hype dies, would you wait for me?
Or be ashamed of me if I chose to bow out gracefully
Cause I know if I don't wanna lose myself
Then Hollywood ain't no place for me
What if I told you I ain't quit
And these drugs still was my rival
Would you regret the fact that you sobered up
And had more heart than your idol
Or accept the fact that I'm just human
Borderline suicidal
And is it blasphemous that these two fingers mean more to me than my bible?
Lord help cause I'm cause I'm hell bound
With the weight of the world I'm held down
Feels like I'm in hell now, maybe that's why I'm havin' this meltdown
Maybe that's why I hate fame, maybe that's why this J's lit
Cause I speak the real and get criticized
So I inhale and don't say shit
And I wake up, to the same shit
Cameras on with their hands out
And that fake smile that I hate now
Cause they the one say I sold out
They the one that will break out when I needed food for my daughter
And I'm the one who can't grow up so these fans replace my father
And these girls replace my momma, they give me love, I don't take it
Cause fuck love, these fucking hugs weren't around before I made it
And since I don't have no family EST is all that I got
Either drop me now or you down for life
Man it's EST or it's not

This shit ain't right (uh)
Cause whenever their wrong, oh it's my fault (my fault)
This is my life (my life)
Now tell me are you gon' ride 'till the wheels fall off?

'Till the nightmares done
'Till the grey hairs come
'Till the friendship disappears that we've had since day one
I said this is my life
So tell me are you gon' ride 'till the wheels fall off?

[Verse 2 - Machine Gun Kelly]
What if this is our climax?
What if everything peaks here?
What if we never get big and these days add on like leap year?
What if you were in my shoes?
Do you think you can fit 'em?
Or would put that gun to your fuckin' head
And regret the fact that you in 'em
Cause this ain't living, this shit prison
Whatever you see in videos, this isn't
Whatever I thought I knew, shit I didn't
Dealing with the consequences of my decisions
Traded the life of a lonely child
That couldn't find anyone to get through
For a life that's filled with cameras
Critisize everytime that I move
For the love I got for my fans
And the loyalty for my man's
Equaled out to the shows we dreamed of
With them bodies pack to those stands
And I did what they say I can't
So I'm living proof that you can
Go be great, chase your dream
We only got one life and one chance

Uh
Straight out the fridge with it
Cool as polar bear paw prints in it
Bitch I'm the kid like ""what you talking about Willis?""
Fresh as new room service pillows with the mints in it
Yeah! I guess the dollars make cents in it
Pun intended, mouth nasty, need rinse in it, Euk!
And that's not no incense
When they whisper that my walk got a funky little stench in it (Damn)
Bitch I'm the shit, couldn't miss the smell
Turn around, give a wave, ""Hi, I'm Mr. Kells""
Never flush the toilet, open your nose please
Haters from high school at my shows in the nose bleeds
""Hi, what's up with you fools?""
I dropped out and now I am the new school
Of this rap shit
Million dollar man with a thousand dollar budget
Still my hand on my nuts like fuck it!
Kells
100 Words and Running, hoped you tied your laces tight
Me, I'm in my Chuck-T's with a blunt up, please we blazing right
Cause I couldn't imagine any other way to bring the year in, now light that shit up!
And I couldn't even fathom any other way to bring a beat in that I like so get up!
Fuck these hoes! Fuck these hoes! One more time like ""FUCK THESE HOES!""
I'm rolling off these pebbles and I'm stoned like these country roads
Me, I'm a city boy, it's going down no Nitty boy
And if its about money, shout my hitter I'll come get it boy
No twitter boy, but I'll get at these rappers names and shit
Fuck all they fame, they bitch just grabbed my Wii, no games and shit
And now he mad, he angry shit
I tell that fool to ""Pay me, bitch!""
But he don't understand cause he don't speak my lan-gu-age
So uh! On to the next one, we up
A pussy's just a hole, and I'm in the country club
Got seventeen mo', and I hole-in-one them all
Stroke the first time, no birdies, eagles or pars
No major deal, we major still, fuck you thought it was?
Don't need no major to tell me that I got a major buzz
I'm major money, tell these fools ""Kiss my major nuts""
They tell me watch my mouth, but I don't give a major FUCK!
I'm major pain and ain't talking bout no Damon Wayans
Look up in the sky! It's a bird
Nah, that's just me high off that Mary Jane
Yeah bitch, I said ""Mary Jane""
And if I could, I would marry Jane
They be saying ""That white boy can spit!""
I'm like can't he mane...?
Shit and fresh, call me ""Mannie"", mane
Under the mistletoe, let her kiss my candy cane
I'm Danny Zuko with it, but I don't want no Sandy mane
I want them greased the first night like a caddy mane
Fuck what they, fuck what they sayin', I'm on some dumb shit
Wanna menage-a-trois, bring your friends, fuck that one bitch
And rappers saying they don't feel Machine Gun's shit
Well I don't feel your music on some numb shit, Bitch!
Yeah! They kiss my ass while I let the beat build
I'm flying G4 looking down, you on your feet still
Shit, where they do that at my dude?
So many haters like goddamn am I rude?
You value menu motherfuckers!
Couldn't afford the cheese on a burger
So don't call my manager asking for verses
Cause your payment for a line of me cursing
Is enough for me to buy a car and throw some D's on it
Like I tossed Pamela Anderson shirt up (Oh My God!)
Don't know what I gotta do to get through
So I slow it down and rap the rest in a screw (Will that do it?)
Yeah!
Feeling draped out and dripped up
So many bitches I need a pimp cup
Sticky's getting lit up
Skirts need to lift up
Haters not allowed and if they come they getting bit up
Someone put the fence up while we get the trees lit
Blow all of this grass til it's only concrete shit
Do not let your feet slip, all black Chucks on my feet
Dip me down
Tie my laces and now its back to the beat bitch!
Said it's back to the beat bitch
Say it's back to the beat bitch!
Yeah! We take it back to the beat bitch!
That's how you let the beat build bitch!

Still remember how that black dress had your curves right
Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves

So what? I brought a record deal to the middle of the map
And I still, ain't blow up
Fuck fame, we don't need no one, me and my team pour up
All day roll up, celebratin' every day we don't spend poorer
Hesitation never get a closed mouth fed
Hesitation never booked a ten day tour, but I did, I did
And that was as a motherfucking kid, in the hood I was a young Brad Pitt
Cause I was that shit, and that's when I was hopping on the 19, grinding, plotting on this, so I need that pronto
Dreaming of the view on the top floor, three million views on a talk show

I love you C-L-E, that's why I'm trying to take us to the T-O-P
I'm sick of seeing suckas busy, always trying to leech, lucky I ain't never charged a hundred fifty for a feat, cause
Everybody want some
Seen me on the television once, think I'm balling but really I ain't got none
Why you think I never changed?
Y'all don't get it
Tell me, how would you feel?
If you went back home and the love's all gone cause you always kept it too real
Tell them bum motherfuckers go and get it on your own
This is for the ones who stuck with your boy like glue

Freshest freshman on campus, no notebooks in the bag
Blinding me with the cameras, never look at the tags
Body look like a canvas, skin is covered with tats
And the Chucks are always the classics
Look like I'm in the past
Yeah
And I stay B-Boy'd up
Neighbors in my business make me wanna turn the noise up
Always been a kid bet I go and get my toys up
Transformer tatted on my arm like the toys yup
Holler at me prime time, any times my time
Every day's grind time, every nights shine time
No chain needed I am just a star
Forever in your life like a scar

Understand I am better than your man
So whatever is the plans

And MTV could never see how I'm living
Cause I don't got a crib I got a car that I live in
Every day different city, four seats, eight women
I'm from city where the terminal towers over
The top of the train tracks
Bring it back ASAP
The hood chicks love me
I keep a Heights girl
And Becky got a benz

And I’m tell em I'm fine
But they say that I’m wrong
They ask me where's my mind at
I tell em that it's gone
Somewhere in the crowds of a big city
At all of my shows, I got em all singing loud with me
And every night I see fireflies, no Owl City
Feet don't ever touch the ground, I'm in cloud city
Looking back I guess I always had a little less
But I always had the biggest heart in this lil chest
My auntie told me I would make it, just a little guess
Now little is just an understatement, I'm one of the best
I’m one of the million, look what I achieved
I‘ll be the statistics, I simply believe
‘Cause I remember back when people never tried to hear me in my school
Now they like, that kid went to my high school

Food hanging out my mouth looking like a child
Like I don’t know my age
‘Cause all I do is smile
And instead of turning new leaves I jump into the pile
That's why I kiss my daughter every chance I get
And thank her mother for stickin with me thru all this shit
Dead broke in the store trading cans for cents
Almost Famous tatted on me, so I can’t forget
So I dedicate this to the mothers with the kids
To the fathers doing bids
To the teenagers who don’t know what having a parent is
To the workers washing dishes, and the players on the benches with bigger ambitions

The definition of greatness 
Is in the making you're witnessing the amazing
Blame me if you awaken
You've been sleeping too long on the one who was chosen mufucka
You're probably unaware but I'm here to let you know it
Take a listen, shut the fuck up for once and just enjoy it: Real Music
Bullshit on the daily? try to avoid it
Your life's ass, similar to a toilet huh?
You see me living chasing everything I wanted, huh?
Forever blunted, ready for whatever coming, huh?
The mailman keep the check coming
The cash in keep the 'vette running
Stop sign? Bitch I run that
Look at where I hung at, 
Bunch of Eastside boys on the field, punt that
Ball 4 life
Give me some shrooms for the serotonin
Me and the crew living for the moment
Everything we wanted is ours

Put me in a fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free cause I ain't trying to live with it

Cause you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon remember me

Irritated with these bitches and their crazy ways
When all I wanted was some head on a lazy day, damn

On the other side of the map taking naps in first class getting paid to rap
Paid off having jobs since the seventh grade
Got laid off ever since I've been self made
See my homie want to see me win
Fronted me some bands told me ""Youngin go and get it in""
He believed in it more than I, So I gotta ride
Down to die for my dawgs, yep, EST 4 Life
Opportunity took advantage I gotta manage
Even when it's hard, hard times, yea,  what would I be without it?
The struggle made me tougher, forcing me to hustle
Money in demand, fuck fame ain't nothing but trouble dawg
I'm never perfect, I got flaws like a lot of ya'll
Who be critizing on the low, hating on ya boy
Ya'll defensive maybe that's why I offend you
When I dribble through my legs in the mall when it's time to ball
Life on the edge, hope I never fall
Though you pray I do, what a shame, but I maintain shooting for the stars
Let it bang bitch i'm out of range

Put me in a fast car, big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free cuz I ain't trying to live with it

Cuz you can make it happen
And I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon remember me
When you see me in that fast car, 
Big house with a beach for a backyard

Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Look...

[Verse 1]
Summer day
Bobby and this girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 2]
Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watches
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading:
“I’ll be home tomorrow. love, Bobby”

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 3]
Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit, damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!!!""
""Wake up!!!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his…
*gun shot*
Summer day, 
An entire family died on that summer day
‘cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain

Taking it to the head with one toke
If only my problems could be solved with one smoke
And is the economy so messed up?
I already know I'm not gonna get the job
So what's the point in gettin' dressed up?
And I done seen my share
Fresh outta high school, lost two of mine out there

Came from the underground now they on tv swear to god haaan
Ain't shit changed 
Fool
You can miss me with that rap shit
You can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn’t lyrical"" barbershop chat shit
Miss me with that frat shit
Only university I graduated was Hard Knocks
I’m from Cleveland where they trap shit
Five bucks for the catfish, five bucks for the bad bitch
Five bucks in a drought in this city could get you a piece of that cactus
With saran wrap for the wrapping
Whatchu mean?
Meaning we bundling all of this loud into Garcia Vegas 
I swear its contagious the way that we passed it
Patches on my denim vest about as old as my dad is
Blood stains on my chucks cus well we know what that is
Jet lag from these long flights still sitting coach like its practice
Feeling like students when the schools back I’m trying to see what first class is 
Cash is the root of all evil
But maybe that’s why I do bad shit
Fact is, I do what I need
Cuz the country we live in is fascist
And no Catholic or Baptist, warlord or pacifist, could’ve seen what I seen without IMAX's and 3D glasses 
Yall in family houses like Bob Saget 
Both parents 
I was on family couches like ""you don’t want it?"" ill wear it
Inheriting hand me downs as a grown man, embarrassed
And these dreams seem far-fetched 
When reality is you’re sharing a shirt, shower, and shitter while your newborns in the carriage
Packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average
This ain't living this is strife, mixed with Hennessey and some sprite
But maybe one day they’ll remember me like they remember Mike 
When I’m gone 
Uh, Kells 
Maybe they’ll remember me when I’m gone

[Hook 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
When my times up on this earth
And they bury me in the dirt
Don’t say that I ain't milk this life for everything that its worth ( everything that its worth) 
And when I die remember me like Kurt, BANG!

And they say Dub quit with that humble shit
You can only be cool for so long 
 Don’t misjudge  I’m not the one you wanna rumble with
Write it down, take a pic
Do whatever you gotta do to remember me
I’m in your memory for infinity 
And the same goes for your bitch 
Remember me from Kennedy 
Or East High on the east side where niggas die over anything
Yeah, Dub-O, 
Oh, you ain't know?
I got go, I rock shows, I be calling plays like Flaco, 
But I’m so Cleveland its a damn shame 
And EST is my damn gang been reppin that since way back and that double X is my campaign 
Pop bottles that champagne its Cliquot for the champions now where the hell is my damn ring?
Biatch, celebration for nothing let you believe what you see 
I’m in the back but no frontin
7 days out the week I be working I’m full of hunger 
That jealousy is the smell of defeat 
Remember who told you
I’m gone 
Remember me when I’m gone 

[Hook 2: Dub-O]
When the time is up on my watch 
And they bury me in that box
Don’t say I ain't give this game everything that I got (everything that I got)

In my eyes now, balling with my top down, roof off, no closed box now
I can hear it in the air like when I stop sound
People looking like I must be lost, if I can't keep a job then I must be boss
And the hustle never dies, so there's no day off
And they be lookin' at the benefits, like ""what that cost?""
Uh-uh, too much for you dawg
Couldn't buy this with the weight that U-Haul
Say you can't stand me, so you fall
??? And it's thanks to ya'll (Thanks!)
Cause now I'm in a different league
Was last, now first in a different scene
Ain't no thug in the kid, I'm a different breed
No couches, just penthouses, this me
And I'm free so the sky's no limit
I don't know restriction, all I know is infinite
Working round the clock, I don't know no minutes
Ya'll temporary to the game, call ya'll tenants
Then think of ya'll american image & combine it with the graphic lyrics that I be spitting
Then take a ride through the city I'm representing
And see their reaction when they see my face on the upper ending
What I wouldn't do for this if I only had 24 to live
Probably take it to the verse, no beat, no chorus, or bridge
And spit it straight from the mouth of the kid, and that's real
I done paid the fee (what's that?)
Two whole cities prayed for me, so best believe when I get what I earned
You'll see those names both faced on the map, word

If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fighting
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it till your body is lifeless

[VERSE 2]
I don't have no regrets
All I got is balls, brains, and a mic, in that sequence
Bad broad coming in the gown with sequence
Doing things to me you'll only do on the weekends
You gotta love this life
Mix the stage with the lime, gotta love that light
They gets on when you bump it, I just call that Sprite
But I'm fly till I die, like a soul plane flight
Yup, infamous, bets on the table all in for this
???
That's glamorous, no back in the ambulance
And no shots gonna cancel this, no blazing glory just cameras
Besides only two hours to go, might as well spend it all at a show
Only 20 dollars in my pocket, might as well buy some dro
And drink till I'm passed out on the flo'
Grab my hotel key, then I order up a penthouse suite
Room service, with a truck full of bottles and some food to eat
And girls strip like it's New Years Eve
Only 30 minutes till the Casket
But I ain't stopping, I'm partying till the last breath
Go hard like I know no half step
Not doing the right thing, I gotta go half-left
As life scenes surrounding me
People only in the room cause the loud for free
Only five minutes till ???
So I'll make love while falling off the balcony

[Chorus 2X]
If you only had one night, one night, one night
To make your dreams come to life then just keep on fighting
And reap what's priceless, you want advice?
Then I said, take whatever your vice is
You only live once, we don't get no twices
Smoking, drinking, cars, dices
Do it till your body is lifeless",Machine Gun Kelly,One Night,
"[Verse]
Motherfuckers callin' my team Scarface, pushing that white boy like Tony
From the blocks to the island like Coney
We poundin' (?), young gun away from nothing, but a couple of pennies
2-1-2, ahh, couple of minis
Now can you feel me, it's just that real biatch, Kells, biatch
Caught ya never snitchin' in 5th Grade, I wouldn't even show and tell biatch
I'm from the city where menace made
I had a daughter, now I'm trying to father a junior, like it's Eleventh Grade
Neighbors look in my garage, like where the whip at?
Haters looking around like where my click at?
Right over there, makin' sure my profit is avoiding the dispatch
Only thing that ain't moving is where my lips at
Cause all that chit-chat with me? Nada
I'd rather stuff these dollars in my pockets, tell the (?) make em burst like Piñata
And though my partners medicated, they ain't ill much
But they do regurgatitin', throw the bills up
This is my life, born winner since momma pushed out a fetus
And these haters over-crowdin' my penis
6'3"", big feet, Chuck T's, guess you know what that means
Get on your motherfuckin' knees and suck these, bitch!
And I will never put no one above my baby mama
So with these hoes, I keep my poker face like Lady Gaga
Give them some intercourse and flight, middle fingers up
That means I give a flying fuck, dumb dumb, listen up
Now let me tell you some rules to this game
Everybody isn't real, only a few remain
With that said, you should never become a business mans friend
Cause his intentions from the beginning is them back ends
And most important, never forget where you from
Cause after it's over, guess where you gon' be? Running home
And last off, never let 'em take the love from us
Loyalty is everything, EST or it's nothin', Kells

What's really good?
Niggas tell me that I made it when I hit the hood
Old girl gave it up like I knew she would
When you saw me, you ain't swing like I knew you would
On that fake shit, that's a Whoopie Cushion
Old from the start type and he ain't gettin whoopings
I could tell, crabs in the bucket if I fall I'll break shells
They hating on Jesus, I ain't tripping, oh well
I'm just tryna live, word to bond
Swipe it like a visa, catch me if you cheetah
Franklin's new Aretha
I am great, nice to meet ya
On my toes like a ballerina
After this shit drop, I won't be making pizzas
I ain't never lie, killin everything moving, Mr. Homicide
Mr. Dinner Date, Mr. My Guy
I been doing this but right now I'm at an all time high
I heard you talkin shit but I'ma let it slide
And maybe your chick too, I shine like a gold tooth
Cause niggas is so poop
Fetch me a trash can, I'm suttin like Shaftman
Yeah, body body like P in 97 man
Ya'll niggas out here lookin like Terry
Ya'll niggas out here lookin like
Made peace with the past, hello future
Can't look back, no time for that
Waiting on a miracle, you can't do that
You gotta go and get it like a pick up order, ay
I woke up out in California, my Cali chick like good morning
Food cooked, weed rolled for me
I just laugh cause I think it's funny
Everybody love you when they think that you getting money
Ay I can't wait to ball, like a bad ass kid, tear up the mall
And she got some on, tell her pull down them drawers
Hit it on the first night, I never call
Married to the game, rockin chains instead of wedding ring
If he in the way stretch him out like a limousine
These niggas frontin they don't want the cake like Anna Mae
I am here to stay, I put that on everything

Never trusted no one so we tuck a 22
Call a couple bitches, fuck em till they mouths drool

I mean a young muhfucka from the 'land too
Trill, too real, too ill
Excuse me if I do not do it for the camera
Bitch I grew up in the jungle, I'm fuckin bananas
My gorillas wit me and m dealer wit me
Wit 50 pounds of the sticky icky
Straight from the ??? boys in the Windy City
Pity, pity these mothafuckas smokin bunk
I light a j and kill a verse, put that shit in the trunk
Back in shaker used to kill em on the table a ton
Bet a couple dollars you could lose the shit if you want
Fuck a rest, still chase change
Always make the mothafucka money
Never let the money make me, bitch
Young gunner, salute when you see me
I live what I'm rapping for real, you just do it for TV, believe me
My hands bulimic, throwin up L's
Those fans deleted wack rappers and listen to Kells
Used to walk up to the dairy market, get me a shell
Cop a gram from the 5 for my homies in bail
Still 357 under the front of my belt
Now my album is selling off the fuckin front of the shelves
This a evolution, a real mothafucka made it, what a revolution
Still muhfuckas hate it, but they couldn't do it
Let me educate the students
You couldn't measure my ground with 80 million rulers
I do this
Shhhh, you could try me if you want and be foolish
But I'm the champion, that means that everyone else loses
You put that money on me, guaranteed you'll recoup it

Tell me, why does everything that's bad feel so fucking good?
Devil in a red dress, she killing me, I knew she would
So bury me one foot for every inch of heel she's wearing
I'm in lust, still, I can't trust this bitch, but I keep on staring
Matter of fact, fuck that, no emotions, let's get high as fuck
I don't need a light, she fire me up
Pullin' out white like a Styrofoam cup
No hair cut, but she lines me up (What the fuck?)
I don't even do this shit
What would happen if my friends knew this shit?
And why the hell can't I refuse this bitch?

She got her legs spread wide for the kid
And she begging me to come and get up in it
Touching herself while I take off my 11's
Got a girl back home and she calling every minute
So I pick up like, ""bitch, mind your motherfucking business""
I'm serious, I'm trippin', no, literally, I'm trippin'
Out of all those drinks, anything could have slipped in
Not to mention what she had me sniffin'
But she grabbed my dick, told me ""forget about it,"" and bit my lip
I told her, ""turn around while I turn the music loud
""Whenever the bass hits then you strip,"" and then she did
But she pulled a little baggie out of her panties
And put a pill on her breast
My mind said no, my dick said yes
I'm willing to do whatever to feel her sex

""Beat this pussy up like you should
""Lay back down, keep it up
""Let me show you how a real bitch do""
All she wanna do is get dick and run
All I wanna do with this chick is cum
I've been in the pussy for about two hours
But I can't feel my shit, I'm numb
Her legs shaking and my legs do the same
But it moves to my chest, to my brain
To the nerves in my face, so I can't feel that motherfucker
But this ain't Novocaine, bitch, quit playin'
I don't even know your name
""What the fuck you do to me?""
She said, ""I'm the same one sellin' Oz to Mike P
""And the one that made you OD""

Ok
Now they say home is where the hate is
Pulling up, “Hi, haters!”
I know, I’ve been on a hiatus
Caught up in the lights I've been blinded by Las Vegas
Ain’t it ironic before I was twenty one
I put my future on the table and I won?
See they told me, “Life’s a gamble”
Now this is my casino
Made sure my fellas good
Now I’m Robert DeNiro, sipping Clicquot
With the girl that held me down from the beginning
My team throwing up L’s
But it’s funny 'cause we winning
A million talked down, soon as I rose from the bottom
But opinions assholes now, everybody got ‘em
So they ask me why I do it
I do it for the streets
Heard momma got out the grill
Man I do it for the grease
Man I do it for the five pack of Hanes wife-beats
That I wore like everyday to show my brand new ink
Shit I remember working jobs, just so I could hit the dance up
Never had a date, so I really didn't dance much
Couldn't buy my own, so I just borrowed my dad’s tux
Told him, “Keep the loafers” kept it gully with my black Chucks
So you can keep watching the stars
But me I wanna be ‘em
And I just beat the odds
I guess we can call it even
'Cause the underdog
Went from flipping patties at a Fuddruckers
To living lavish then a muhfucker
God damn!

[Interlude]
Ooooooh weee!
We got stories for days man, for days. They just got to listen. Ay Slim! Oh and if y'all don't know, that's like my best friend right there. But any way it's safe to say we're on our way man. Bout time though. Shit! Ay you remember when my dad kicked me out right after we met and I showed up at your house the next day with a U-Haul like ""hey you wanna move in with me?"" Or matter a fact, nah, nah, you remember the time we had those two girls over and Dub called like ""yo these dudes tryna jump me up here at The If!"" Oh that's what we called the store across from our crib, ""The If"" cause it was on a 130th. But anyway though man we left the girls there sitting with the doors open, sprinting to the store, ready to fight, and this fool closed like ""ahhh got y'all, I was just playin'."" Damn I still wanna whoop his ass for that shit. Nah, nah, nah, nah, matter fact you remember when you wanted to buy your first keyboard? So we went and gathered up spare change like everyday and walked into that bank with a heavy ass bag of nickels and they were lookin' at us like man what the fuck? Hahaha we too grounded to be Hollywood. Man, this about as Hollywood as Im'a get. Peep this!

Hold up
Okay I heard they want the classics
My life’s a movie like the Truman Show without the cameras
They look at us like we a couple Boyz N Da Hood
Four Brothers till the end like them boys in The Wood
So I Light It Up, for them Friday Night Lights with the team
In The Notebook, holding my Requiem for a Dream
I was Superbad in the class I just Dazed off
So I played sick and lived Ferris Bueller’s Day Off
Back in Cooley High, students used to nickname us The Goonies
Every night we blacked out, shit they should’ve called us roofies
Get out of bed Half Baked, roll another doobie
So many snacks up in my house they call the crib Scooby

Early morning cutting corners
Rolling up this marijuana
Stole it straight from California homie what do you got on it?
My cup holder filled with Tropicana
Couple grams of Aunt Jemima
In my hand like candid camera
Vibing to that Country Grammar
Pulling up to Grandma's 
I smell bacon, eggs thats scrambled
Hoppin out then ol' boy ran up
My dog grabbed the mc hammer
*blammer* *blammer*
Make him dance
And watch him run up out their sandals, 
But fuck all that, where's my sandwich
Let's blaze up and change the channels
Look on TV and I see me
With that Chief Wahoo on my beanie
""Wild Boy"" video on repeat
Only white boy on BET
EZ Widers + hydroponics
Roll one tall as Spike Lee

Cleveland boys don’t give a fuck

Gotta call Big Chuck he the OG
And get a zone for the low cause I’m lil bro
Everybody on the Eastside know me

I’m bringing a Grammy back to the city this is the anthem

$1.50 every meter
Food wasn’t guaranteed I stole my meals out of Arabica
Speakers blasting my own shit
Bow tie on the jet on my grown shit
Court side at the game with the owner
And sell the same arena out when I’m homesick
God damn I'm a fool
Couple hundred diamonds in the tooth
Couple hundred bitches in the pool
And out of a couple hundred rappers I am the truth
That's why I get a couple hundred when I’m in the booth

Don't y'all get sick of this regular shit?
Just bought me a new outfit to get a little spit on my dick
I was an outcast till I had no money for rent
So I started counting my singles like arithmetics
Then I, stepped up my game like I put my foot on the light
Of the way I wanna get at, told everybody that I had no limit
Fuck privileges we coming out the poorest city
Public subsidized housing, smoke a little weed when they get down some
Money came up short, the crew bouncin
Straight showers in the rough to buy a few mountains
And we, didn't even get over the hill
Didn't even make it through the field
Fuck what anybody throwing at me, I ain't settling for another
And I ain't stopping until I get a meal or until I get a deal
Get it in the streets, they don't need to sweat I got beretta for the heat
Because in the Land there's a dead man
The day I become passive, they all passing me
Actually, naw factually you don't talk, you speak after me
Copied everything I did, let's see if I quit this shit
How are ya'll ???

Can I get a little peace?
Peace, peace (that's all I ask)
Can I get a little peace?
Can I get a little...
Can I get a little peace?

[VERSE 2]
I'm so close to severing ties with these posers
But these posers hold the power to cut off the path to my career like Moses
Choking cause I'm so sick of being overlooked like telescopes
When I never asked for a hand-out but goddamn can I get a rope or something?
To pull me in from the open, ocean that I've been floating
Those sharks circling my boat, I damn near drowned and seize up, hoping
What's with these ??? tryna be both or they just croaking
Wanna be grown, I ain't ever wanna be MGK always coastin'
Flows always been the coldest, wordplay always been the dopest
My bites always been cobras, me and hip-hop go back like togas
Tell my kids I was a motherfuckin soldier from the time that I born
Up until the time that I done grown up, keep my boy from off the corner
I don't wanna have a suit and tie for funerals like I'm joned up
Because peace these days doesn't come in nothing but the forms of bullets and comas
And how am I supposed to live life when I'm so broke but
Used to the lavish life, I pray these days are almost over
Focusing on the road to, success and I'm so close but
Struggle blocking my progress, give me strength for Lo, Jehovah
This night is almost over, its darkest before its dawner
So please heavenly father, can I get a little peace?
Heavenly father please, can I get a little peace?
Peace, peace

I like to keep my issues drawn

All these pretty lights, 
Can’t you see em?
Endless nights
In my life's museum
Where we see our heroes
And pretend to be em
And we seize the day

Previous to this dream state I had leftovers on each plate
Left shoe all tattered up from this long journey my feet ache
Left the life that I lived because everyday was just replays,
And I dreamed big, walked around in my PJ's
And my street days are still here
Never changed like I still wear
The same pair
Phone call? what for?
We ain't long distance, I’m still there
Still on the blocks where gun cocks and gunshots are more familiar of a sound then what’s ""hot""
12 dollar showers at truck stops would give anybody motivation that you must not lose this one shot...

Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be 46 years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it (Ayy!)

Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go on Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' 50
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff?
When you the one that called Diddy (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke

Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up!

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it

[Verse 3]
Hello Marshall, my name's Colson
You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi!)
He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me.""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy!)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)

Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm a asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker
Oh my God, Ronny
Fuck Kells!

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr!)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you! (Thank you!)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy!)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh!)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim!

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)

Yeah
Can we please start over, now that we're both sober?
Even though that won't last long
I swear this love is a sad song
I spend my nights at the strip club
I pay them girls just to get love
I pay them to lie to me
One of them girls gave her line to me
I spent my night at the strip club
I pay them girls just to get love
I pay them to lie to me

Even if the highs feel low
Even if you couldn't sleep because you couldn't feel me underneath the covers when your eyes closed
I'm gettin' faded 'cause our love is fading
If I'm a monster then it's 'cause you made 'im
Beauty and the beast, now that's an ultimatum
Go with what you love, or follow what is gonna save you
Woah, I think we went somewhere we shouldn't go
Maybe it was Vodka, maybe it was blow
Maybe it was nothin', maybe it was both
Maybe it was the secrets I ain't want you to know
Maybe I wasn't leavin', maybe you made me go
Maybe there was a reason for our behavior tho
Maybe it was the pills or the house on the hills
Maybe it was the thrills, baby this love kills

Don't cover my scars, let them bleed

In my hood money equals power
& in the world money controls everything we believe & I can see we're in are darkest hour
Cause It feels like the government is as crooked as the police
I spent the week catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied in school
Because some dudes told her she wasn't cool
& You would rather gossip about a famous person breakin' the rules
I'm confused
Tell me is my life's price worth the jewels
They tell me fight night, I'm supposed to loose
Just cause in high sight, They don't like my type
White Boy with some rythem & blues
Kells

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
There's a line in there where I said ""A girl committed suicide after she was bullied in school
Because some dudes told her she wasn't cool
& You would rather gossip about a famous person breakin' the rules
I'm confused""
And It really puts a lot of things in perspective with how we are in society right now
Cause we would rather talk about a famous person getting a DUI
As opposed to shedding light on how serious it is that there are boys & girls that are 15 years old, lost, don't have the sense of how to be a man or a woman yet hurting themselves
I was doing a meet & greet & this girl came up to me & asked if I could sign her arm
And I looked down & she had cut her wrist, I mean from about here were her elbow is to her palm
And it was just like gashes
So much pain & I signed my name over it, she took a picture of it & a year later she posted a picture of that same arm & there was no cuts, I mean there was no more pain & It was just scars that will probably never leave
But, It was a beautiful thing to see my voice influence a change like that
We're blinded by all this other bullshit that we don't even focus on the real problem
I mean, I wanna take people's eyes off of the celebrity & put it on the people deserving of our love & attention

See I was born to rock and roll

While my daddy was a rolling stone
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh

Who remembers tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents?
Who remembers sneaking into liquor stores tryna get bent?
Who remembers stealing every album out of pop's old car?
And listening to those growning up tryna be a rock star
Back in the days, back in the – back in the days, backpack full of Andres
That's three stacks and The Chronic, no wait
More like three dollars and a 2Pac tape
Principal calling my dad, ""Colson isn't showin' up to class
Colson got into a fight, your son isn't gonna pass""
Well, your damn right, my books were in the trash
I was at Sharks, playing guitar with the band, jam
Pretend like we were playing for some fans
Go to chance, pretendin' like we was paying some bands, ran
Security caught us we, got banned, now dad's at home
Drunk, waiting with heavy hands, bam
So I ran away with whatever CD it was that I was gonna play
Music always had my back when it's just me in the dark
Fell asleep on the slide in the park, wake up!

Today I took four shots
Leaned out my window and pissed on four cops
Noise complaints every day, knock knock
But I'm busy with four porn stars on my cock
Busy damagin' hotels and gift shops
Quick to shoplift, take a wrist watch
Put me on a stage at a show and I mosh
I done shaved so much blow that I rock
Do not try this shit at home
Seem like every morning my lawyer is on the phone
Talkin' 'bout another fight or another case from another night
With a dude backstage at a place upstate but I'm done with it
My life, have fun with it; call my little brother Rook, tell him ""get the drums hittin'""
Tell the rest of the band to plug up, and yell to the rest of these bands to shut up!
Mic check 1, 2, if you don't like me than check your IQ
'Cause I ain't dumb, my mind is just numb from all the substance inside that I've done
I had to try some, be wild while I'm young, go in the strip club with all of my ones

With 11 of my closest, on a mission to get rich like Danny Ocean, how we rollin'
All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

Smoking on sequoia, running from my paranoia
Hollywood want me to come and live and die in California
I ain't going out like River Phoenix
I wanna enjoy all of the spoils
I'm a Golden Boy like Oscar de la Hoya
I'm a soldier masked up like it's the end of October
Blowing doja in the streets with Mannie Fresh down in the Nola
I done told ya, when it comes to beefing, I ain't kosher
Bought a cobra just to keep you snakes closer
I can spy a motive, y'all can try and clone this
Get them lies quoted, but him and I know this
Line up my opponents, hold their eyes open
Rip out their hearts and let 'em all die soulless

Wait, I heard 'em say they want the old Gunner
Fuck 'em, I still turn coyotes into road runners
Fuck a family, I'll leave your ass with no brothers
It ain't no love when you become a man with no mother
That's what it was
I used to get my ass beat just because (For real)
I ran away and hit the trap, they couldn't make me budge
Junior year, my homie selling crack right off the bus
Knew that I wasn't turning back when I got cuffed
Fuck a charge, this a territory, y'all don't wanna march
Cemetery full of graves, I can finish what you start
Lost a milli when they sued me for a fight inside a bar
I hope you pussies think of me every time that you see the scar

All these signs show me they want me gone like I'm Makaveli
On the cross when they cross me over, over something so petty
Kill 'em all even if I die like Method Man did in Belly
I am... Gun Kelly, ain't shit you can tell me
Get me drunk and mad enough, I go pop the trunk of the Chevy
I'm a dad and a savage, this is not an image like Getty
Rap for currency, like I'm Spitta Andretti and let it fall like confetti
Ball for my dogs that they got locked in the celly

Remember hitting 93rd back to Slim and Dub's mom's crib?

Bitch I still feel that way people say that way
People say that attitude will get you killed one day
But even in my wake nobody's safe
Cuz ""keeping fake fucks out of the game"" is in my will some way, okay?

I'll put the hands to em, they need hydrocodone

On the corner with some youngins that be styrofoamin, turn up, 
I'm advanced with the burn up
25 L's for your man that's murder
22. Cal in the pants, that's murder

Just stop now, you're not gonna make it
That's right, get your shit and run away again

I'm so tired of running, that I've worn my soles out
To the point that my toes is out
To the point that I can’t look back
And even if I did I still couldn't see where I started out
Can’t see home for miles
Lost like another orphan child
I’m only grinning cause I’m supposed to smile
So I do it for the ones that are down and out
Proud one of those is gonna be a spokesman now
But I’m still running, running, and I don’t know where
All I got to my name is one pair
Of laced up chucks, five bucks, and a chip on my shoulder that’s so big, that I cannot bare
I done lost my friends, family, and home for this
And for that I have lost my mind
Kept my faith, lost my direction
I’m just praying that I haven’t lost my time
Go!

I keep my head up with my feet on the ground
From the bottom so up is the only place that I’m going
Ready to face all that’s in front of me now

Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowing
Ready to face all that’s in front of me now

I’m so tired of hustling
I can feel my heart fill with hate
I’m so tired of loving
I was supposed to be great
I’m so tired of ducking
Tired to coming home from a job being fired from nothing
And shit I’m tired
From the nights a muthafucker took that ride
To make that dream, come alive
To wake up in the morning to a nine to five
But I gotta do it if I wanna survive
Because in the city where I’m from it’s either do or die
So choose it wise
Because you could lose it in the blink of an eye
But even in the darkest times
It’s proven I -

I bet I pull their fuckin tongue out
Nowadays everybody be thinkin they ballin'
I came around and home runned on these players from the duggout
Yeah bitch what now
Hat to the side
Bags underneath my eyes
Got me lookin like I'm strung out
Can't even get outta bed
Without a pair of original chucks laced up
Then we lookin to run out
Look at who I brung out
Every show and every single city I step into
All the greatest people come out
Every single stage I'm on
Ima dumb out
Yelling EST untill I blow a lung out
And thats why I love my fans
I swear my fans are my fam
Took it from the bottom
And we never goin back again
Lace Up Cleveland's on the map again

[Verse: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, from the bottom of the ash I rose
Yeah, to the top I go
Where I’m from its cold
But I don’t need this coat (nah)
Keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city’s area code on my shoulder (whattup)
216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove
Like “fuck this broke shit,” petty ass hustlin
Couldn’t even sell one zone
Slim still workin' at the store and the only time we ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here
Prayin for a rainbow to lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to
Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that ""I made it""
Cause’ real EST mufuckas don’t fold
Real EST mufuckas don't break up, real family grows old
Real EST mufuckers representin' for the city where they came even when they gone
And fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the eastside
Just these broken homes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get they fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep
Muthafuck this rap shit
Try buryin' your boy six feet, let me show you 'bout real
Try telling me that you can’t make it up out the city 26 dollars to multi-mills
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the eastside still
Well bitch I did, and it's still the kid
Labeled a Bad Boy before this deal
What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that bled with me knowing I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Lookin' at the house of pain
I’ma runaway from the ones that pay me
Hopin I’ll stay the same

[Verse 1: MGK]
Every day I, wake up, to the same shit
In the same house, with the same bricks
In the same clothes, with the same kicks
I might as well be in jail
Caged in, stairin' at the wall waitin' for a change but
Dad telling me I gotta get a job
Couldn't pay the bills so the lights turned dark
Them Cleveland boys got it hard
Oh my god, we been living like this too long
Just to lose it all in a week
My people too strong
Get it? Me and my boys be blowin'
Puffing on weed like this the lawn
Me and my boys tired of being here
That is why we gone
They say we wouldn't amount to nothing, huh?
Y’all thought we was bluffing, huh?
Fought every temptation shit, I guess I’m David Ruffin huh?
Nowadays, we don’t gotta do that dirt, tell my boys they good
And nowadays my little girl won’t have to work, moved her out the hood
Look man, I done been through it all, and I’ma damned if I got this far
And if I let them strip me of this message let these haters take my heart
This for the ones that had it hard, the ones like me, the underdogs
This for the ones that waited for them clouds to form, please god let it

You can't see my tears, in the rain
Underneath it all, we’re just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
All around the world it’s just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
So I let it rain

[Verse 2]
And they mad that I made it out the city
But if you look I'm still out in the city
Before everything I had clout in the city
Toured the states and never bounced on the city
Shout out to everybody that’s proud in the city
Everybody cheering in the crowd from the city
Everyone that never had doubts in the city
Cause they know I represent what we about in the city
And I’m still laced up, tell the world that’s nothing changed
Till it’s hundred dollar bills in my pocket, then nothings change
If my team ain't with me, then I don’t wanna thang, tell them I'll go broke before I run out on my gang
EST over everything
100 thousand plus, cult fan base yea that is us, my songs tattooed on they body troubled youth, we bad as fuck and what?
Nobody gave a shit about for broken mirrors
So I care less about appearance
Just as long as they can hear us
We’re fearless, we’re stupid, we’re dealers, we’re loser's
We’re killers, we're orphan's, we’re addicts, we’re stealers
We’re shooters so kill us
We are what they say we are until conformity hits us
Or those clouds come down and take them all with us, please god let it

Original chucks on laced up like I'm taking them on a run
They're begging me not to kill it I tell them I'm having fun
They're asking me how I do it I tell them get on the rail
Meaning get on﻿ your grind I'm ready now what's the deal
My size 11s skate on the surface like hovercrafts
A superhero you think that I was a Thundercat
I run with villains my village calling me son of Sam
Simply cause when I come around they st-st-st-stuttering
My body's tatted they say I look like graffiti
That's why I be on the roll these regulars try to read me
The way that people be staring you'd think that I was a TV
But when it comes to the haters I cannot see them like Stevie
But I be seeing repeats of dead rappers like 6th sense
My competition ain't worth nothing like 6 cents
Misfit I swear I'm sick shit you'd think I was Ryan Sheckler by the way I make the kicks flip
Too cool hands shakes and dap serving all of these fools like pancakes and snacks
Whoever thought that I wouldn’t be damaging the tracks
Was pulling they own legs like hamstrings and calves

The type of dudes that'll make ya mouth drop down
Faces looking twisted like we guzzlin' Ciroc down
We're just city slickers in search of them bigger figures
This is more than a game my business isn't a scrimmage
And I be with the sickest cause I'm trying to be the illest with them Die Hard fans like Bruce Willis
Pow pow
I'm in the cut like alcohol in the wound
But I'm tripping like I popped Adderall on the moon
Focused on killing tracks like I'm rapping them from the tomb

I was smoking OG kush and lemon haze and shit
Bad as fuck, I had it tucked inside my backpack in the front

He kicked me out, he had enough so I got up
I'm in the kitchen, baking pizza with a crust
For a paycheck I can go and spend on hella drugs, yeah
Spaceships see me when I'm up, yeah
I been a martian with no Elon Musk, yeah
I'm in a party with the screw-ups and the sluts, yeah
I'm rolling papers bigger than elephant tusks, yeah
I'm in quarantine, but the weed man pulls up here
I got a hundred packs of backwoods
I can spend the next four months here
I spent 10K cash, I might cough up both lungs here
Filled up on gas and got high, but no stunts here

All that I know is a W over my clan, I feel like Raekwon
Only time I get an L is when I be throwin' 'em up for the gang sign
I been a king with the bars but now I can play guitar and the bassline
I heard them saying they doing it first, I'm doing this shit for the eighth time
I used to want a pool, now I'm waking up and I got one in the backyard
I break a lotta rules, so you know I be drivin' the whip like NASCAR

For all that it's worth
To live in the spotlight...

[Verse 1]
What if life was simple as a hug?
What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot
His mother's make up smearing on my arms, 
Crying cause' I'm the only son that she's got now that he's gone
What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal? 
You telling me if we couldn't shoot a ball
Our lives still got shooting involved?
And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?
But fuck it this is life
Deal with it or get dealt with
I'm in my room smoking alone like I'm selfish
Cause' some days the sun's hard to face
Dad turns his son wears his face
But look closer see the heart of a lion
Sticks and stones couldn't damage my bones harder then iron
170 pounds with the walk of a giant
So defiant I pop a Valium, turn up the volume
Turn up the volume

And all that it could be

Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?
(to live in the spotlight)
You'd let me die inside for you...

[Verse 2]
Look
What if money wasn't part of success?
Would the people I used to be friends with never left?
What if making a name didn't come with regrets?
I think that fame's a pre-cursor to death:
Death of a friendship
Death of a family
Death of a man
The misunderstood are always dead before 'they' understand
Staring at ceiling fans, chop up milligrams, draw a pentagram
Lucifer's not a rumor he's in the band, (damn)
Liquor and vomit on my Converse
Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser are plastic orange bottles of peer pressure
And I'm ready to cave, I live in a cage
How can I be a hero when I'm the one needing saved
48 hour days of this fast lane living
Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out than fade away is what Kurt said
I felt the same until I saw his daughter and thought as a father
What if tomorrow; the only I could spoil her was dying?
Started crying then popped a valium turned up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume

Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?

You'd let me die inside for you...

Turn into a stage and a spotlight?
And everyone around you starts to hate cause you got right
And feel entitled like I'm supposed to stop living my life?

Two clicks north of the Bronx
Whoever thought she would of found love in a stereo
2 headphones and a box
She picks me up, every morning on the walk to school
She ain't worried bout these other little kids
Cause she told me everyday you sayin' something new
And you always got the illest kicks
Boom Boom tat
And she takes me out, just so the block can see
Told me she wanted the world to know
So she makes me loud now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers and she's all mine

Whenever her daddy comes around, we just hide
Cause she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why

Voted the most popular girl in the class
Cause whenever were together we attract the crowd
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cause at all of the parties, I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song, she might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on, play the music soft
Yeah, so that's what I do, anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up, cause I know my cue
But when they gone, I'm back at it
She loves this song, so I blast it
Dad gets home, I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch like gymnastics
Uh and I'm a always be there for you, you just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love

Uh, and she gets older but I stay the same
And as she grows up, her opinions change
Now shes off at college
Where there's other ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then, I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin' about us
Waitin' for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch and get that rush
But I'm not what she needs, so I power down
Then right at that moment where I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So so I said

And that was a dark depressing time for him, you know
He did had one visit with his mother I think
During the time that he lived with me and she brought
Him a huge box fill with gifts you know clothes and all
Kinds of little goodies and stuff and it sat in the corner
Untouched, literally for months he'd never opened anything just
Left the box there

[Verse 1]
What's going on in your mind when someone you haven't seen since you were nine is out at your door step right now?
Rewind, remember that one time when Marco showed up at the front door
And we found out he escaped from a psych ward
And stole grandma's car?
Ah, rest her soul
I know that's off topic, but I miss her soul
So ironic that she was blind but told me I'm handsome I was
Every time that I walked in the door
Can't lie and say it was easy being 14 on February 14th
Watching a body die in my arms
Then have to go to a school that I hated
When my grade indicate that I don't give a fuck what's going on
A couple hours later on
And not to mention that one bitch that I loved
By the way I call her ""bitch"" because she was
Wanted me to catch another man fucking her
Invited me over, told me to come into the front
Come upstairs and say what's up
And there she was
Little slut
I was broken hearted, should've broke that bitch's jaw
Just for playin' me like a chump
But instead went to the garage, grabbed one
Of her brother's rifles, went outside, and shot that other
Mothafucka's truck up
I guess that's what lead me to cuffs
Becomin' common in my life like funerals was
Daddy's less common now, he gave up
After he heard the judge pin a fucking felony on his son
Funny enough
Me and Aunt Barbara even closer
Start to feel some weight lift off her shoulder
Till it  piled back on when a radiologist] told her
That she had breast cancer and might not live much longer
Fast forward
The woman that I call my ""mother"" isn't my mother
Or even blood but that's how much I love her
And I'm feeling awkward cause the doorbell's from the person that I call HER
Maybe I ain't ready for it...
Shit, what should I wear?
Fuck that, I ain't going down there
I waited over a decade for closure
Why should I receive it if it might not be something I want to hear
In the mirror is a empty reflection
And in my head are questions I want to ask like, ""Where the fuck did you go?""
Why did you turn my birthdays to the worst days every year that you didn't show?
And if you must know, I didn't turn out to be much else
Than a drunk who fell face first to a pile of hell
Took four snuffs of the devil's dust
Ended up with my manager helping me cause I couldn't take a piss by myself
But I did get a record deal
And all my records got that making of a legend feel
And I did have a daughter who I promised that the way that way you made me felt
Is a way she will never, feel
Slip a Benadryl in my cup
Ech, fuck it I'm sickening up
Pit of my stomach clenching, all my muscles stiffening up
I ain't been this nervous since I got jumped
Flick the tip of my J over a surface cover with ashes and junk
Took a pull and sat it down
Put on both of my Chucks
Reach for the door but my hand's sweaty, I'm anxious as fuck
Couldn't even hit the stairs without remembering how many years I was there waiting to see your car pull up
Now you saying she's right there?
Man you saying she's right there?
You telling me if I open up this door right here
That she'll been standing right there?
And after all these years am I wrong for having this fear
Of meeting the reflection that was missing in the mirror
Open up the door and then I see her

*Opens door*",Machine Gun Kelly,Story of the Stairs,
"[Intro]
On a east side night
Under that street light
On the corner of don’t think twice
I find my mind where it shouldn’t be

[Verse 1]
Crack Rock in that pad lock
With a stash spot in my ragtop
Street dreams down the block from my dads spot
Bad cops on my payroll
At a buck a pop like Faygo
Add 50 Cent for like 3 keys
Open up the doors for that Yayo
White nights cuz I make snow
Bright lights then I lay low
Fight nights I'm like Mike Tyson
K/o for that peso
That's the life that we chose
Talking bout
Money cars and these clothes
Fuckin with
Twenty broads that's exposed
And we in the
Strip clubs till they close
These are the chronicles of a hood muthafucka doin what he gotta do to get paid
Chronic smoke In every follicle of my shades
Writing  my obituary diggin my grave
Cuz all they say is jail or death,
And I figure there ain't nothin left
That I ain't did and since I’m knee deep in my shit, don’t hold my breath
*Snap* Oh shit
Guess its back to that broke shit
Roach clip in my ashtray
2Pac on my posters
Dreams of living like Sosa,
But I'm wakin up on this sofa,
Said I'm wakin up on this sofa
I ain't waiting round here no longer
Get it how you live it bitch we livin dirty
Most of us that's livin now ain't livin thirty
Get it how you live it bitch we livin dirty
Cock that .38 put on my mask and it gets blurry
I don't think you heard me

[Hook]
What I need a shirt for?
When you beast shit and you go hard till that tours gone and you back onto that street shit
What I need this shirt for?
When these tattoos that I bleed with say everything about my story come read this
What I need a shirt for? Huh? X3
When I go hard
So hard, to get everything that I worked for

[Verse 2]
At the top is no friends dawg
At the bottom ain't shit dawg
Middle man'n ain't it dawg
Plotting drinkin this Hen dog
And I said lord my savior
Have I not protected my neighbor
Have I not neglected these haters
Have I not kept you in my prayers
So when my life keeps going downhill am I wrong for looking upstairs?
Am I wrong for feeling you hate me, am I wrong for thinking you'd care?
Am I wrong for keepin this weed lit and these smoke clouds In this air?
But I can't sleep without my mind gone cuz of shit I witnessed last year
That boy that left out was just family
I ain't see the shit comin
We was supposed to be at these Grammy’s
We was supposed to be stuntin
Shit,  we was supposed to somethin
Fuck that we was supposed to be brothers
Helped you out when you were struggling, I don’t owe you nothing muthafucka

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Am I loud and clear?
Or do I gotta scream like I did every day when I was a troubled teen, huh?
Do you want to know my past and see every single scar and know what they mean, huh?
17 running up in Mickey D's begging for a double cheese, huh
Singing ""I don't want to grow up don’t nobody like you when your 23""
I came from nothing but a fucking unsupportive father I don't ever see
I had to watch a crooked jury put my brother in the penitentiary,
I never fit in
Criticism, made me the man I couldn't be
I'm reminiscing on when life was different spending every day at Chuckee Cheese, uh

[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
We live on front porches  and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I’ll slave till the end
And I’ll run these streets if you give me a chance

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I've been here so long
Maybe I should runaway
Try to find a summer day
What is love
Love is pain
Love is butterflies and stomach aches
Love is looking out a windowpane, tears dripping looking like you’re in the rain
For someone you don't even know but for somebody you may never see again
I am only alive once
And I'ma die when God wants
So fill the sky with diamonds
Because that's how it's gonna look when I'm gone
Had a vision as a kid that one day I would change the world with my song
Several years have passed and now that vision came to life that boy's a fucking icon

[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
We live on front porches  and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I’ll slave till the end
And I’ll run these streets if you give me a chance

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Sometimes I don't want to fucking wake up
When all they want to do is bring me down
And all the things I’ve went through as I came up
Are the fucking reasons why I run this town

[Hook: Kellin Quinn & Machine Gun Kelly]
We live on front porches and swing life away (and to my fans, I told you)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance
We live on front porches and swing life away (all my dreamers)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage (stay real)
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end (and to my love)
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance (stay here)
Swing life away (what we do)
Swing life away (and what we do)

Damn, (Peter Parker) 16 not a kushy in the jar take a hit now I'm floathig next to Pluto
Super bad, used to dream one day I'd be a star, Hollywood big screen like Juno
Yeah, so I hopped up out the bed
Said fuck school layed at the crib
And lived every single punchline that I have ever spit
Cause reality to me is behind my eyelids
Gone, and don't mind my ad-libs
A lot of these rappers young but I am that kid
(Kells) That piff, chillin' in the hood, light it up
Now my minds in the heights like where my dad lives
Can't hate though, not at all man
I'm in the stadium and I am not a ball fan(No)
Or a ball player, just freshman with a team, now let me ball hater
(Swish) Leaning, give me my balls hater
Jealousy took over their lives, I'm the cause hater
And the most 10th graders want my autograph paper
Meanwhile my bread comin out the cheese grater(Ha, bitch)
Yeah, I am the greatest
So bad when they need me, they be saying tsk tsk
Boy, I'm raw as this fish in the sea
See me, get off my bitch's dick
At the cornerstore, heavy dog
Pull up in the lot, open doors, see heavy fog
All I needs a brownie, Arizona and a funyon
Plus a hotdog, extra relish got the munchies like a muhfucker
Blaze up till you face up
Got the hardest bars in the game, step your cage up
100 words and runnin', you better lace up
If you can't tell I'm a star, step your knowledge of space up
Uh, Gangsta? Nah I'm fuckin' with ya
All my girls back in Shaker, yo what's up with ya
Up in their blouse, boyfriends couldn't trust me
Couldn's stay in the house because the streets love me
And everyone who hated just mad they couldn't become me
Ain't it crazy I'm celibate when everybody says fuck me
Probably cause they think your boy musty

Kells, never been a punk
Always had hands, tall skinny city boy, white skin black chucks
And everybody that wanna challenge me you can do whatever you

[Interlude]
Alright hold up stop that, stop that goddamn
I don’t think ya’ll know whats going on right now
This is the kid, MGK, Machine Gun Kelly, and this the mother fuckin’ mixtape, 100 words and running, Lace the fuck up, Kells!

[Verse 1]
Uhh, Kells, never been a punk
Always had hand salts in a city boy, white skin black chucks
And everybody that wanna challenge me you can do whatever you do
But you ball, I dunk (Swisssh)
You thought them up
Sleeping on the bottom in on top of the bunk
So when the machine’s getting something to eat
You wanna breathe bitch please now use that tongue
But don't use that wrong and tell your boyfriend who you used it on
She calling me daddy and her boy Lil' Jon
So if we gotta problem then let's get crunk(Yeaah!)
I-I am what you wishing for
The dropout will receive what you paying your tuition for
Said you wanna rap tell me what you spitting for
I am the only great white
Get it, what you fishing for?

[Interlude 2]
Hold up stop stop, I just said I am the only great white and I'm a white rapper
And great white like a shark... 'what you fishing for?'
Ya’ll don’t get it...

[Verse 2]
OK fuck that bring it back
This is what I gotta do to get my city back
No we at the east or the southwest any that
Straight down the middle like a goddamn KitKat
Yea, yea no mornings because there isn't no sleep just yawning
Trying to get a house on the prairie on top of the hill
Now wheres my awnings
Oh and if we recording put this song in the obituary
Have my manager notify Yonny and tell him I killed his beat, I'm sorry

[Verse 3]
But kells is just a beast like that
Got a beauty on my arm call Disney tell them that the beast is back
We beat that weed is crack show me where the freaks is at
Not a stain on me, you would think I'm where the bleach is at
Up front let me beat the back
Give an uncle like my niece react
Came without a snorkel but she show me where her beach is at
Surfs up the cat got me riding her body waves, positions change
Now I'm all over her chest like Axe body spray
And she can't even go down and get my rocks off (Why?)
Cause so many haters dangling they rip my cock off (what?)
Nah, I'm just playing, but you for real though
How 'bout you get off my sack and buy yourself a dildo?
Or buy yourself some steels yo, selling 16’s like pills yo
I'll get your career rolling, rolling no wheels bro
So what I gotta steal fo?
Even though I'm in the spot that ya'll kill fo
Cause if you watch Finding Nemo y'all the Krill fucking meals ho
What the deal yo, what I need a deal fo?
I got every coast in the country dancing to my songs; heel-toe

Nine digits full of the zeros on my check
Now where’s my pillow?

Girl I know
I know you bought me the watch
You ain't get it back though
My name's on the back though
I flipped the lock to the back door
And took the key under the mat though
I know you hate that
But you did some things that you cannot take back
I needed change
Left a nickel for a dime
That is a payback
""What you sayin?""
Bitch I'm over you and I ain't playing
Should've been a one night stand
But here we go again....

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you

Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you

Please never call me
Do not mention me in any stories
Do not show up at the homie's party
Come up to me and then say I'm sorry
You're just a
You just a — hold up let me stop
The Henny shots got the petty talk comin I don't wanna have them thoughts running
Can't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach
Fuck is wrong with you
I don't even get along with you

But the head was phenomenal, 
Used to do that in the car with you

Used to travel around the world just for the rendezvous

200 RPM, behind the wheel of my mind's GM
Praying they don't see him
Swerve around the drama from my BM
Wondering why all these people wanna be him
Stuck in the matrix but doesn't want no one to free him
Cause in reality fantasy's all that's left of freedom
And reality's a bitch and that's why I say I don't need'em
Just a substance to keep me sleeping so I can keep on dreaming
Fuck Tylenol PM, someone THC him
Smoke away all my problems, eyes looking like Koreans
You're only here to rap, other ambitions simply keep'em
So I'm clenching down my gums like a baby when his teething
What they saying in my face ain't what they thinking, they deceiving
I'm about to live up to my reputation as a heathen
And put my size 12's into place where they eating
Til it comes out the other end like a mother that's conceiving
Just be glad you breathing
It's summer and my heart is still freezing
Cause back home it is kill or be killed season
So I'm watching my back, bet I'm familiar with treason
People threw me in the lions den alone for no reason
""Fuck em"" if they hear him, but shut up when they see him
While my family wondering why new breads in my ATM
But how can I fit in a cubicle when I'm a coliseum
Just know that no matter where I fit I do it off of Cleveland
And Mile High

My walk is so cocky the bouncers don't even stop me
Ain't no pat down, no ID
They know me, that shit obvi
Bitch I pack out the lobby just from fans tryna find me
I got daughters and mothers tryna fuck with the gunner
Two tone suit like the Joker
My Harley Quinn wears a choker
Let them suicide doors up
So much smoke, can't photo us
I'm out west like the gold rush, 1942 poured up
I ain't spent one night sober since I turned 20 years old
But I'm on my Jeezy in 2005 ""Trap or Die"" shit
That everything 100, this ain't no facade shit
This that ""Look me in my eyes and don't you fuckin' lie"" shit
Still don't need no opinions
Bitch, most these artists my minions
Whoa
Yeah, turnt
Any weed around me finna get burnt
No lie, I'm on fire
Hogtie anybody need a realization that they fuckin' with the wrong guy
I am the Alpha Omega, came from Sonic on a Sega
Crumblin' chronic on the table
Mumbling lyrics in the basement
Like I'm finna go Super Saiyan
I'm saying, I ain't have a plan coming out the land
Hanging with my man, tryna slang a gram
Just to rent a van, just to try and tour
Turn some common clothing in to couture
Still muddy from the sewer
Look at all that I've endured
All them years I couldn't afford
Friends thats in the morgue
We are not the same, say the fuckin' name

Let's do this for real
Super sonic, super sonic
Psychedelics and some chronic
Still remain the trending topic
Five movies, let's be honest, what you call it?
That's a major motion picture wallet
No, I do not want to comment
Don't approach me, I am violent
Snapping pictures 'cause I'm styling
Let me make it very fucking clear who I am
Do not start assuming, let me clear confusion
I am not a human, they call me a giant
I pick up the mic and I start a riot
I spit a verse and I change the climate
Fuck a dealer, man, I need the pilot
Drop the weight off like he on a diet
Hanging off of the balcony of the Hyatt
I started with one, then I multiplied it
Now I got me 3 women like Frankie Lymon
And I got me a double X made in diamonds
Bitch, the dynasty never dying
Someone ring the sirens, I just broke the silence
I just sparked the loud up, who the fuck can stop us?
I resort to violence, no resorts and islands
You know where to find us

But shit I moved on, to bigger and better
I’m smarter and wiser, so this shouldn’t be a surprise
See me pull up in the foreigner size of shotgun shug where I used to reside bra
You gots to be in the gym, physically fit if you comin for him
You already know that I’m coming with them, trigger it in cause you sink or you swim
So don’t get down cause you might get drowned cause I don’t fuck around my brother
So don’t make a sound just shut up before I hit you with the quarter pound muh'fucker
Anybody wanna catch a square anytime, any place I'll be right there
Standing in the middle of the motherfucking street
Ready with them hands and I'm ready with the heat
Took all my feet that I been that I look
You can play if you want but you will get took
Bumping them gloves, oh look you a piece with a hook
Real quick life is bitch you shooked look
I wrote the book on this real shit
25 years and I still spit
Murder the mic and I kill shit
And that's something you folks have to deal with
Bring me your boss and I put him to work
Eat him for lunch and then that's fo' dessert
Fuck with me and your feelings get hurt
Then I put you to sleep, take a nap in the dirt

Run and tell them that it ain't pretend
No fake news, CNN
Run and tell them that I lay the pipe

That must mean the double X's on my chest ain't the only thing hung
What did I do to deserve this?
I can tell you if you listen
The difference is you a gimmick, I earned this
Someone give me some detergent
I just came out of the mud
Wipe my sneakers on the rug
No ID's for the club
No idea where the stash is, hidden pocket for the drugs
Tell the police suck my dick like sluts
I will not budge
Nor will I trust, I am rich like Russ
I used to grab my daughter from her mothers house on 112th and Dove
They tried to kill me in my dad's truck
I had a 40 in my pants tucked
You know I am from the land of
Young killers, no manners
Put the purple in the fantas
Eyes red like Santa's
And now a driver pulls the van up
Now they watchin' me wit' cameras
Had to shut down the campus
All the way to Los Angeles
See ya'll got me on some trash
Got me speakin' on the past
Like I wasn't on a private jet with Dan Gilbert gettin Kyrie at the draft
Like I wasn't shining on my XXL freshman class
Like I needed these collabs
Just to get these plaques
No, I got plenty of 'em
Man I'm solo on many of 'em
Y'all know I changed rap
Live shows I changed that
Mosh pits since way back
My guitar, I play that

Power. I bloom, no flower
Swisher Sweet full of sour
That's a juxstaposition
Shut the fuck up and listen
Just to meet me in the present is a present
Meet me for dinner at seven, a celebration is in order
Book me a table at Beauty & Essex
I don't need the menu neither
Bring me some Yellow Tail and tequila
Used to eat Taco Bell every evening
That's what the fuck I was doing in Cleveland
Aye, worth the wait
Third album on the way, y'all know I slay
I shotgun pump, I don't pump brakes
I'm my favorite rapper alive
Since my favorite rapper banned me from Shade 45
I wonder, what now?
It's the Gunna (click clack, keep going?)
Look, ya'll don't gotta hear shit, ask anybody in the 216
If my name rings bells in them bricks, everybody know who that is
So what you hate boy, you late boy
You ain't heard about that great boy
The 3 letter name caucas' boy
Used to live right there up the way boy
Man you heard about him, said the name
Saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and then bought the shit
And put 'em on a playlist right next to Jay
Yo girl saw me and I signed her tits
Disappeared, you couldn't find the bitch
And your heart stopped, you know what time it is

Still doing the same shit
March 30th is when I turn myself in and go to jail, man
Till then, keep making them hits, nigga foreal

[Verse 1]
It’s just the, trials and tribulations
This world is fucking crazy
When I’m screaming “free my man!”, the crowd’s screaming “congratulations!”
Cause we came from couches, to family houses, to corporations
And I know these streets are a dead end, but these streets embraced me
People I fuck with call me 'Kells', that’s what the streets named me
Fuck where you think I’m from or how I live, the streets raised me
And fuck the world for hitting my girl with that stray
And letting tears roll down my face onto her casket at the wake then
And I'm thankful for living this long, cause a lot of us don't make it
R-I-P to homie Rock who got shot after graduation
And Jo Jo was an animal, I guess that’s why they caged him
Caught in a vicious cycle of life as a young teenager
My history class is bullshit, they feed us false information
Fuck the founding fathers, millions died over Benjamin Franklin
My brother fought in Iraq, but it might as well been prison
Cause he’s home but his sanity ain't come with him

Hold me down, keep it G
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep

To be the realest muthafucker that I can
That I can, that I can
Remain the realest muthafucker, that I can

Jesus died for me, government lied to me
These people say they loyal, I just hope they ride for me
And if I die before I wake then cry for me
And keep my muthafucking name alive for me
Look, I done seen some things that I would never tell my daughter
And did some shit that I'm ashamed of to get her what I got her
I know the Devil’s hot, but I got something hotter
And they ain't from Jamaica, but my boys are fucking Shottas
We never start no fights, but we'll go to war
EST tatted on us, that’s something we'll die for
These faggots had shit handed to them, but we earned it
Roll a J, yell out my window ""Lace The Fuck Up!"" then I burn it
Turned into the opposite of what they thought I would, skipping classes
Voice of a revolution of troubled youth, kiss our asses
And if government conspiracy's a lie
Then why the dollar got the all seeing eye?

Ay tell'em Im'a need a minute, damn
My heads fucked up
I be thinkin' jail whenever hear'em say they need a sentence
I be in the booth zoned out
They say they just need a couple lines
And all the years on the road got me thinkin' blow
Even though they just wanted some bars like jail time
See there I go, somebody take this drink from me
I love my bitches all
Please God don't let them take none of the pink from me
And since you need a filler for the dead space
Sorry I had to get my head straight one of the homies back home caught a fair case
And how I'm suppose to feel
When I'm in Hollywood tryna get a couple mil
And I just got a call that my dawg got killed
And maybe it wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have been out'chea but
Even still, even back when Dub had a job cuttin' steel
Even back when we was on the block up the hill
On Hundred Thirty-First there was blood gettin' spilled
I ain't re-invent the wheel mothafucka
This is how it is where I live mothafucka

It's deeper than that, you know what I mean? In so many years and all the shit we been through. That's definitely my brother. I do for him, he do for me. And it was always like that. Ain't shit change. Same mothafuckas we grew up with. We're still boys
He never really been for the bullshit, he's one hunned

[Verse 2]
Ay Im'a need about an hour
And a first class ticket, wait
Make that a jet and a champagne shower
Oh I ain't rich yet
Fuck it I can make a dollar and a dream work
I was on the cover of the double X-L
I ain't talkin' 'bout the big T-shirt
Lace up I'm finna run circles 'round squares in these Nike Airs
Finna go hard with my dawgs that were right there
Finna treat songs like a mothafuckin' pound
And flip an empty house to a mothafuckin crowd
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout ,yes sir
Errbody better pay respect this year
I be in the Land with a steel texture
Object in the waist just in case they test first
Bitch I'm from the east side, east side, watch First 48
I owe nobody, just know I rep, rep OH, get it?
Fuck it if you don't I'm just ventin' like I use to do like these
Rappers I will never mention
How stupid are you?
To think i would give you my attention
When you're nothin' but a peasant and I am a fuckin' legend
Can you feel that?

[Interlude/Outro]
Once we got to our high school, they weren't teachin' shit. So we would just go do whatever, get some money, whatever. But we were was always good at kickin it though. He would want to battle and shit, you know what I mean? Like he said he wanted to rap, so we would push into random battles at school. You know what i mean? I just knew one of us would make it in something. You know what i mean and i just felt that",Machine Gun Kelly,Therapy,
"Yeah, okay
Now there’s a meaning to this thing called life
But you just gotta find it in this thing called strife
I wish I could rewind and show you this is all hype
Show you just because they stars doesn’t mean they got stripes, for real though
But me, I got them verses that’ll kill though
And me, I’m EST, now that’s a family I would kill for
Shout out to the fans who held me down before the deal though
And I can’t forget my team, I pray one day we make a million, and blow it all
'Cause when we die we ain’t taking it wit' us
Materials make a king, knowledge makes an apprentice
Now ain’t that backwards, we impressed by the fame in this era
My girl a queen, she don’t need a tiara
She don’t need an umbrella either just give her the reign
We don’t need help, they built the pyramids without a crane
Insane sometimes I feel we born without a brain
We only looking at the dollars, what we really need is change
I'm sayin', if that shit doesn’t register, might as well get used to stealin' singles out the register
Baby momma calling, she need 30 for a pedicure
Student loan collector blow your phone up on the regular
How we supposed to live baby? This isn’t it baby
We supposed to have a condo and a crib baby, damn
But you forgot the first rule of the game
They don’t remember riches, they just remember the name
Kells
Uh, so go and get it homie
One thing for sure I know the block ain’t gonna get it for me
Two thing’s for certain, I ain’t tryna let 'em pigeon toe me
And if they is just know I’m walking wit' my pistol on me
This ain’t that B shit or C shit, this is that D-O-or-D shit
That means Do or Die, 'cause ain’t no you, if it’s you and I
I ain’t a gangster but I will be just to stay alive
I’m rollin’ in the cut, staying high
Roll to the cinema and stay the night
My life’s like TV with this daytime drama
All this Law and Order, a lot of comedy
And relationships like Tina and Ike, these bitches craaaaaazy
That’s why I’m tellin’ ya
Look up at the sky instead of starin' at a cellular
You could be the greatest, why would you wanna be regular?
Just know that your greatness comes from how they gon’ remember ya
Not from how you spend baby, that isn’t it baby
You ain’t gotta have a condo or a crib baby
But now you know the first rule of the game
They don’t remember riches, they just remember the name
They don’t remember
They just remember the name

Kells
Rose from the ashes like a Phoenix
Rows fillin', rows fillin' up in them arenas
Got my weight up in my hood we call that triple-beamin’
Fuck introductions, skip the name and just call me Cleveland
Homie calling for bail, tryna get out this precinct
Tell ‘em we give ‘em hell, funny I started preaching
And when I say I gotta respect the city you gon’ believe it
'Cause everybody left us and they know I’m never leavin'
So I turn it up one time for the days standing on the corner
Talkin shit and getting lifted, sippin’ brews and Arizona
And when one time came through everybody gone except for me
I couldn’t leave, I am a loner, with the mind of a stoner
And dreams of putting this game in a choker
And fuckin' her till she pay me like Oprah
I’m not a hoper, I’m a knower
Of what's in the forecast like Al Roker
So even if it pours, I am Noah, two oars
Two rowers, row us to two shores
Found promised land, now we lying on two floors
One for the fam, the other for two whores
Fuck two minutes, I did this in two chords, of course
I’m too versatile for a chorus
Done too many tours to be a tourist
Fuck the magazine, I am The Source
I am too bossed to be employed
More stories about your boy than Chuck Norris
Kells, listen up!",Machine Gun Kelly,The Register,
"[Intro]
And they say they know me...
Get the fuck outta here
Only God knows what I've been through, man
So if you wanna talk, get your facts straight first
And if you really wanna know, let me ask you something...

[Verse 1]
Have you ever walked in the shoes of a giant?
Or had to fill the position of a boss before you were even a client?
It's no wonder growing up under the roof of a tyrant that I would be the poster boy for defiance
Now I'm the voice of the silence
Fuck being quiet I've seen twenty years worth of violence
I'm tired, it's a burden for me to open my eyelids
Not an undercover cop but it's safe to say that I'm wired
I can't even get a grip on my life with pliers
I'm fucked up in the head
Close my eyes cause I see demons around my bed
So depressed, open them up hoping I'm dead
Thought the fame would make it better but it only fucked me over
Never used to touch a bottle, now I'm hardly ever sober
People want to be my friend
But where the fuck were y'all when I was ten
Eleven or twelve getting bullied and beat up in the gym?
I couldn't never get a girl, now all the sudden I'm the man
Students try to get back cool with me again, fuck 'em all
Because guess where they're gon' be when my record stops playing?
Gone with the wind, off in the record shop saying that ""Kells fell off""
I knew it would happen, stop hating, cause a month ago you was all over my jock saying
That I'm ""that mu'fucker""
But now I'm whack, mu'fucker?
Opinions change, but you cannot change facts mu'fucker
If you want bullet points then call me a gat mu'fucker
I'll lay my whole life out like a mat mu'fucker
Man, I've experienced some things that would stop you from eating
My schizophrenic cousin tried to end my life while I'm sleepin
My bummy uncle wanna call now that he sees me succeeding
My momma left me for a teacher, lost my dad to the preaching
Half my friends are buried six feet, all the rest in the precinct
Literally watched my Grandmother die from Diabetes
I guess my prayers were answered when my Aunt got Cancer and beat it
Now I want to get her out a job, give her the garden of Eden
I did a lot of bad shit, God got even
But for the price I had to pay, I wish I'd stopped breathing
My girl sat in the bathtub, eight hours bleeding
Hearing the doctor tell us our child's heart stopped beating
Fuck a million, I wouldn't take a dollar for a life
But I will do what's in my heart, and trade this dollar for a mic
I wrote this song in hopes that it could help someone get through the night
With no intentions of getting paid, I'm just doing what is right
I do it for the fans, no, the real fans
Who stuck with me through the storm cause they understand
That there's a genuine pain behind the words I'm saying
And they embrace me, so I thank y'all for staying
Ain't it crazy, that passion is my achilles heel?
Either that or keeping it way too real
But they don't know how it feels, to feed off the energy of a crowd
Step on stage and they get loud
Dad, I'm gonna make you proud
I know we don't speak right now but I think turning new leaves is what we need right now
I love you
And you may not see right now but I'm begging for forgiveness, I'm on my knees right now
You saw your son as a dropout
Stuck around when I ran
Saw your son as a felon
Now see your son as a man
See your son be a father, to a beautiful child
Or just see your son Dad, see me smile
Who would have thought what started at the bottom would someday grow?
From three people in the crowd, unpaid shows
Six people in the room, one meal a day
Another opening act where no one knows my name
Saw the demos that I passed out laying on the ground
Saw the rappers I befriended copying my style
Saw opportunities pass while these fakes got rich
Now I can't stop speeding like my breaks ain't shit
For six months I went through hell and back
Right at the height of my success all of the sudden doctors said I couldn't rap
I had a polyp on my vocal chords
Left with a choice, stop now or possibly lose my voice
But I woke up and recorded every morning till my throat swole shut
Coughed blood after every show because it hurt that much
I went weeks without even saying a word to myself
No health insurance so doctor bills piled on the shelf
But for my daughter and my fam, and every single fan
I pushed through it, now I'm back for y'all again
As for my competition, this is the beginning of the end
But right now this is my return, amen
Kells

[Outro]
And they say they know me
Get the fuck outta here",Machine Gun Kelly,The Return,
"They be sayin' ""best rapper alive"", who?
Kells, who you wanna know?
I chop them motherfuckers down, they fallin' like Geronimo
Haters wanna holler though, hoes need to stop it
I will hit a bitch and pass her 'round the room like a Bop It
Back to the topic, uhh I think forgot it
Fuck it, I love talking 'bout my dick and how these riders jock it
Fuck him, fuck him, she's cool, fuck you
And if someone got a hater I'mma show 'em what to do
Make sure you puttin four fingers down, keep one up
Say if you ain't talkin bout no money please shut up
Me, I'm on the come up, I don't know what you bout
One million, two million, let me know how you count
Yeah, nominated youngin' of the year
I ""red rover, red rover bring the money over here""
Steer, make sure I remain in my lane
But that's symbolic cause I'm really on a plane
And I red rover, that's ironic because I don't play no games
I don't pass the rock like Jay, I ain't fuckin' with you dames
Only like what gets me paid, I ain't fuckin with you lames
Already pale, where's the raise? I ain't fuckin with the shame
I want the limelight, and the lime slice in my drink
Chain and whip without the slave, and the bitch that stays paid
At the bar buying shots, cherry bombs and grenades
Cause I go hard, you can carve it on my grave
Now wassup man I crave, travel side, first block, where you stay?
All my people back at Shaker and my partners down the way
Uptown to the Heights, St Clair to E.C
An anywhere on the eastside you're liable to see me
Boy I'm about to make a milli, but this not the C3
This 100 Words and Running, I am not Lil Weezy
I am daddy to these hoes, fuck a lil pee pee
So if it's you, or me, your girl make a choice, easy
Uh, I'm spittin like I got my braces in, so much saliva my lower lip that I can't take it in
So I gotta hawk it up, spit it on the microphone
Family say I need rehab cause I can't leave the mic alone
And for that I'm guilty, but until they kill me
I'll be nasty in the sense that on this record I'll be filthy
Not literally, I'm bacteria free, the flow is ill so
Vaccinations given couldn't kill my skill
""Chill, chill"" how you gon tell me to chill doe?
When I'm hot and being slept on like a pillow
Better wake yo ass up when I'm on these instrumentals
I'm the reason half of these rappers wives turn into widows
The type of shit I been on, no toilet to sit on
Need my quarterback even though I'm sittin in the endzone
Filling all my rillos with the leaves off a willow
And that's how I get down - straight up like a dildo, gone",Machine Gun Kelly,The Start,

Tattooed to the sandals, fuck a bitch while I stand though
Burn a little wax, no candle

And you know I will steal a rich boy Lambo
And drive that mothafucka straight to a bando

If she come wit me, she ain’t comin back
Tell her put it on my lap, clap it like a jumping jack
Run up on me if you want I’ll tell you to, I’ll run it back
I wonder can he handle that, naw he can’t handle that

Open my phone up, every day to 80 voice mails, from 80 different callers
But to keep it 100, y’all really know Kells, nah
Underestimated, but over stood, let’s just hope I’m a knock, knock, on wood
But either way I’m on another level thank the swisher
Ladies love when I’m around say I look better than the pictures
God damn right
I coined embrace the expression that I am fly
Cause I’m high as fly and above all of them land lives
I’m like Picasso with this damn mike, listen up
I gave the game stability, I am the missing crutch
… call me collector
Even know they hate me, you don’t have a choice but to respect it, ha
Peter picked up Pepper and I just picked the dream
And fell asleep now everything I do’s a movie scene
But I just wanna live, and never act, blow a pack and and run it back

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Now everybody from my city knows the name Kid
My father thought I was a screw up, till I blew up
Take a look at what the fame did
From stains to stainless, fridges in my cribz the illest, getting lifted like the planes is
Them one come and go, but the heart stays
Trying to keep my mind free is them junior high days
I guess we came a long way since the myspace
Seem like my name is all over the country like the highways
But they telling me the that home where the hate is
Well fuck that I’m gone then my spaceship
Been ready for take off
See me on Venus with extraterrestrials, puffing the greenest of the space raw
Already reaching and god willing if I make it to tomorrow
I’ma wake and dedicate this to the ceiling
Cause the fans make sure I’m on my mission
This is the pursuit of happiness fuck a million
We just over here living

[Verse 3]
Which is why I never put down the blunt
Surrounded myself with the realest
Which is why I never put up a front
But I did turned my back though
To everybody’s opinion, and gave the critics a reason to kiss my ass
Hi bloggers I know my skin’s a little different
I guess I’ll blame the lack of presence on my skin pigment
I’ve been dough, I’ve been flyest then rest of them
I just always been ill and they got the medicine
Guess I wouldn’t want me around either
Vocals sick enough to fuck around and get listeners to jungle fever
Look at me now pops up in the sky box, a few clearer than eye drops
And I rock all the shows all the hoes and more
Open up my closet looking like a clothing store
I don’t never wanna grow up, Peter Pan
So roll it up and lets hit neverland kellz

[Outro]
And everybody who just trying to make a living
Doing whatever they goata do to get it, put your hands up
Whether you work on the streets or in the buildings
Everybody that is handling they bizness, put your hands up
Me I’m just chasing the dream why they sitting
So everybody who isn’t bullshitting, please stand up, please stand up

But I really live this, Jimi Hendrix 'till my lyrics hit 'em
Then Bob Dylan asked why I ain't on the television
Cause a premonition of John Lennon said the second you preaching the message is the minute you Zeppelin
That means on the stairway to Heaven I go back to the two family homes
Where my daddies cologne would cover up the fact we Rolling Stoned. I got places to roam, reading through a text on my phone from Billy Joe, saying 'You are the next Joey Ramone.'
Smoking Chili Peppers outta bong, Kiedis recognized the tattoo on my arm said Flea and em' told 'bout my songs
I turn around ""What's it gwan' Bob?""
Getting gnarly with Marley, smoking barley, trippin' in the party with Steve Jobs
And they say ""we need marriages in our lives"" fuck dat!
Tell my bitch ""I'm with Marilyn tonight.""
Ringside yellin' to Muhammad, during the fight
Sittin' next to BIG and Puff, Bad Boys for life!
Black flags and dice, hashtags and flights, ripped pants and Nikes, a black pen and a mic
Cleveland my city, I tatted dat for life!
Real people with me, haters hashtag and type
Trashbags and fights, we fillin' this motherfucker
Me and hoes buying bottles we spillin' this motherfucker. Heard Nas even bought Lauryn Hill in this motherfucker
Like, good goddamn they filling this motherfucker!
Pac said ""I live the Thug Life.""
Aaliyah on my arm, boy I got a Thug Wife
Drunk nights with, Nikki Sixx, now he's on a heroin binge
Me and Morris are snorting anything we touching again!
An, Imma, Sex Pistol, everything I Sid Vicious
I'm making Johnny Cash haters eat my Limp Bizkit
Fuck with it or Gorillaz your decision
But I Will Smith & Wesson anyone of my opposition
And all these critics reframe from speaking my name
And these newer artists feel the same, they Nicolas Cage
Mean they Gone In 60 Seconds, get up out my way
If I ain't critically acclaimed, you're clinically insane
Bitch I ain't ashamed of where I'm from
I'm not ashamed I'm not a trophy fathers, trophy son
I'm not ashamed I got a daughter and support her instead of being a baller flaunting every dollar
Bitch I'm barbecuing cus I'm A1!
I can't front, this life we live is a blessing
Dreaming about the Future but everyday is the present. Whether they accept my music or they try to forget us
Here forever, bitch I'm a motherfucking living legend
Feel that! Uh, yeah this beat, I killed dat
Kanye made the beat let him heal that!
Uh, uh, let him heal that

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I like the way this feels man
Kells bring it back to the map, right up in the middle of it's where you finding me at
Labels wanna holla, this is where they’re signing me at
Cause my city told me they need me so I’m grindin' for that
Same clothes, same street, same chucks, same feet
Same kid I used to be moppin the floors up every week
I paid the cost to be the boss
Let’s just say I ain’t cheap, cause now the same kid is living off a check from every beat
I’m from middle west, where they don’t forget where they’re from
What they’re representing their home mines just tatted on my arm
And I forever be about it as long as air is in my lungs
Speaking to you as the kid and I'm as real as they come
I made a dollar out of cents got a whole nation’s respect
Before I was 18 and I did that without a check
See I used to be a lame now I’m posted in the game, in a top spot
Tough drop, money ain’t a thing

Let me get them, mid west, let me get them, go

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, dedicated to my fans and everyone who wanna see me win
I swear my life’s a major motion picture from beginning to the end
Only thing is I ain’t Hollywood and this here ain't pretend
Haters try and pull me down but I’m too high up in the air
Here I’m try and talk down but I’m too high to even care
I’m on top of the world and I got my baby girl here
She don’t worry about a thing as long as daddy’s right there
Yeah, from the bentches to the league, fought through hell and back to get a dream
Cause as a lightweight, you gotta learn to use your pounds right
From the bottom to the top this is for victory sounds like

How'd you run away from the place you brought me?
I did it to myself though, go ahead and blame this on me

How to keep that money on their mind and make their pockets fatter

Questionable lifestyle, but they don’t know for certain
That we just don’t give a fuck, cause we condone cursing
I wanna get that dream and live my life
With no Rihanna, no T.I.,I’m just living for today
No tomorrow, no pause, no comma, real shit, no persona
I’m enjoying every pussy like a virgin or Madonna
And I took it from the basement, yeah
All the way to first place and I’m feeling good
Need a somebody to save me from the cavemen running my neighborhood
Now I never wanna come back, I don’t wanna touch, smell or feel the crowd
I just wanna live with my alter ego in my world
Well it feels like the world is spinning round, and angels asking if I’ll be coming down
But I don’t know if I wanna do that, because up on this planet is where I grew at

Cowards devour instantly on every hour literally
But this is our symphony, and when you know it’s time to end with me
Just make sure that when I’m gone my child lives for me
And if we blow let’s talk in show, take another way up there
I’m a man of many moves so in space I’m prepared
Landed in a plane I bust shit I’m already from here
So when I’m classified as alien I don’t care
Peace out to the citizens I’m gone
Let the other ?? and know I’m home
ET from the CLE believe my adrenaline is ready for the long haul
It’s slowly up and out of space get me out of here
Cause when I’m grounded everyone the same every where
Which is why I must be foreign wit it why? cause it’s like most these rappes boring in it So what you saying?

Try to stunt on me the worst coming
Motherfuckers gonna need some plumbing I am the shit
And I feel like eating something
Feeding my stomach
Give me a rapper, make it a hundred
Fuck it, give em the hubble telescope
They couldn't see the youngin'
No, fuck it let 'em get a lil something
Bring em to the block do a lil stuntin', that ain't nothing
Everywhere where I go I'm putting on
I ain't bluffing
Everywhere where I go I'm putting on
Bitch I run it
Kells

[Hook]
This song got a motherfucker feeling like Pac tho, (thug life)
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
This song got a motherfucker feeling like Pac tho, (Thug life)
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'

[Verse 2]
Picture me rich
Picture everybody with a picture of me hangin' on the wall like Prince
Picture your favorite R&B singer
Lookin at a picture on her phone of my big ol' dick
Picture me living like Biggie
The real Frank White, I'm the king of my city
Picture all this shit starting as a dream
Staring at a picture of  Martin Luther King
Bitch that's my reaction
Trying to make it happen from rapping
Trying to avoid me a casket
Half of my kin-folk caught up in traffic from trapping
My whole squaddone turned to a fraction
Cause Tony Montana right up the block from us, dawg
It's hard not to get caught up in it at all
Hard not to ball
Sales for yayo, then jail, then someone goes talk to the law
Please God tell me it ain't true
Tell me name on that paper work ain't you
If you ain't snitching then why is you home
Stupid decision bitch better get gone
3 in the morn, I can't get rest so I turn over pick up that .38 special
You bust in my door, then I bust at your neck hoe
25 stranded on death row

This song got a motherfucker feeling like Pac tho, (Thug life)
