Got a hundred shooters sittin' outside
Got a hundred shooters sittin' outside

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, uh

Famous ho, she threw me that pussy, I'ma slay her raw, yeah
You are now welcome to the Player's Ball (You're welcome)
Whole lot of money, lot of rich shit, yeah (Woah, woah)
Hundred shooters, I can get your clique hit (Woah, woah)
Get my dick sucked in a Lambo while I stick shift
Big shit, baby, it's the big fish

Shot up in her DM like James Harden, it went swish, swish

Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands

Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage

Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it

Hell no Ain’t  buying no Jimmy Choos, already told you no
Quit comparing yourself to my baby momma, everything will go
Georgia mud I sip it by the pint, I’m bout to overdose

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me
On a whole ‘nother level, me and you we light the room up when we together
Every time we havin' sex we gotta break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
And we don’t wanna go to sleep, cause we too obsessed
With the high life, and we gon' blast up like a rocket when the time right, and when the time right

[Verse 1]
And your style is impeccable, you’re so fuckin’ incredible
You don’t drop off your pedestal, well you shine like a bezel, boo
Saks Fifth Avenue, I'm tryna buy you the avenue
You a astronaut baby, everything we do brand new
More water than Cancun, me and you we some Tycoons
We light up the whole room, we're hotter like May and June
More love than February, this-sh ain't no fairy-tary
The highest level you can go, we blow up to legendary
This outer space lingo, I put what on when it's necessary
You an honor to me, I got that lumber like trees
I wear my heart on my sleeve, you got my heart in my stomach
Without a doubt in my mind, I'm takin' off and you comin’

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me

And we don’t wanna go to shleep, cause we too obsessed
With the high life, and we gon' blast up like a rocket when the time right, and when the time right

[Verse 2]
Top floor of the penthouse, on the rooftop poppin’ bottles
Shawty she go both ways, anytime she go smash models
Addicted to the high life, me and you we ‘bout the same
Gucci, Louis, Prada, when we walk it ain’t no thang
Got them VVS diamonds they don't bling, them bitches blang
Say you wanna go to Pluto, me and you, we are the same
Baby, tell me you can gutter and she fire to the flame
Remain full of spin like woo ride plane
Take of take off take off take off and blast
You almost never prepared you’re in a whole ‘nother class
You are sidity, you pretty, lights, camera, flash
Focus on your future ain't concerned bout your past

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me

She the red on the bottom of her shoes (on her shoes)
I’m in her brain like I can’t lose (I can’t lose)
And it ain’t nothing for her I can’t do
And when I’m with ‘er I got nothin’ to prove
She accept me for me and I take you for you
We get high as the skies and get past the moon
We got a special connection, we could light up the room
We some astronaut, maine, no cartoon
We outta here, we eatin ass and we gon' never gonna Earth with you
We ain't never gone touch the surface again, designer gear is all we in
Outer space status, the most incredible bond
In it for the passion, a whole lot of fashion

That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it

Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk

Put the codeine in the Sprite, and then I'll have me a drank
Smelling like a pound of loud when I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp, in the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign, and I'm cool as you think
You need to turn it to the max if you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes

[Hook]
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat

Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs

I'm on a real strong pack, that California OG

Fuck your permission, I'll get to them digits
Come to your town and I get and split it
I get them stacks and get busy
I get that gat and get busy

Hop out the 'Lac on some pimpin'
Step to that bitch like I'm Goldie
Half of these niggas? they bogus
Most of these niggas? they bogus
I go to coast to coast, I'm fully loaded
I hit the lights for roaches just to scatter
I had to go to work with heavy metal
I done seen dead bodies in the ghetto
I seen these bitches dancin' with the devil
I seen that money make a bitch evil

This shit gettin' colossal

We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with a kickstand
I serve that bitch with my left hand
I'm 'bout to open a meth lab
I set the blow on the jetway
Called up some places for some big faces
I be in B-More like I'm a Raven
We trap out this bitch 'til the police raid it
I seen that coco turn bad when it get in the pot
I'm sorta like a chef when I'm over the pot
I'm sorta like a ref when we talk 'bout these streets
Whistle official, my pocket gorilla
We trap out these buildings and make us some millions
Poverty didn't get the best of my game
We took all this game and went bought us some chains
We fucking these bitches, ain't none of 'em gettin' claimed
I'm straight up deranged
I jump out the Range
I go to the Flame on a Wednesday
That molly, that drank and that kush
I think I went over my limit
Stack after stack after stack
I'm throwin' this shit to the ceiling
Got three Audemars and a Bentley
And it's one hell of a feeling

This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

They take my kindness for weakness

I might end up with your ho if I take one (still comin')
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one (still comin')
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one (still comin')

I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)

You a real rider, you a rider, shoot the chopper with your left
There some solid guys on the other side tryna get us dead

She got two personalities, I got two percs on me
I'm 'bout that 500 degreez work on me
Too many problems with these freaks, can't let it work on me
I seen it first hand before it's holdin' you back
I let the first hoe I fell in love with play with these sacks
Started going crazy off of that pot drinkin' that Ac'
Start to have a whole lot stacks on me, servin' that crack

Snatch a brand new Range Rover with the captain seats
And I keep a MAC on me like I'm Master P

I'm gone past the moon, what you tellin' me?
That nigga's a goon, what you tellin' me?
The bitch in the room, what you tellin' me?
I'm hotter than the sun, what you tellin' me?
These niggas my sons, what you tellin' me?
They eat up my crumbs, what you tellin' me?
Your brother a bum, what you tellin' me?
Straight out the slums, what you tellin' me?
I came out the mud, I'm stashin' the drugs
Gotta bring out the tub of Ace
I was never in love with the Wraith
Got a new Panorama on the way
Went to Pluto, beyond with my cape
Can't run when the drum in your face
I'm the mothafuckin' don, why you hatin'?

Drove it too long, time to swap it out

This money put a lot of demons in me
Went and tatted all these angels on me

The new Giuseppe's, I had to purchase by the bundle
Them presidential Benz's, you can tell I'm doing numbers
They jocked a nigga style and they had turned me to a monster
I was swaggign to the max, I had to turn it to some commas
It fucked wit me a second, got it right back out the jungle
I'm eatin five-star dinners, living like my nigga Stunna
Get some cash nigga, get some fetti get some lumber
Make it rain money, make it hurricane, thunder
Running to the check, while the check steady coming
I ain't gotta flex, cause I'm really getting money

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad
She harder than a dime
Finna drop the deuce in fo
Try to scratch a hard nine
If you trying to find these shoes
They gonn be hard for you to find
Rocking presidential rollies, it ain't hard to tell time
I had my ups, I had my downs
In my lifetime, committing crimes
I'm chasing paper everyday
And it ain't hard to see I grind
I'm turning up, I'm turning up
It's gonna be hard to turn me down
I'm a motherfuckin star and it ain't hard for me to shine (straight up)",Future,Hard,

Crack in the bushes, I'm tryna buy me a new '88 Cutlass Supreme
Every day hustlin', I gotta go get it
I gotta get Wu-Tang, man, gotta get cream
Long as they print it, my niggas gon' get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finesse you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up, now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it, they'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up and put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we jugged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin', yeah, yeah
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit
I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated tryna fight the demons
Tryna find right in my wrong, hope my legacy live on
Hope my legacy live on
That's why I wrote this song
I ain't have to write this song
Future Hendrix is forever

How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

[Hook: Future]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud

Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 3: Future]
Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

I change up my hoes like I change up the weather
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot

I can't wife no thot, forty at my spot
Smashed her in my drop, got some crazy top
I done damn near wrecked, off that hoe neck
I got a little bit of flex, I damn near was obsessed
All that is is a bougie freak
Saddity bitch from Laguna Beach
Pussy good and her throat deep
Sucked so long, made her nose bleed
I ain't savin' no slutty, I hit her and her and her buddy
Bought the freak a little puppy but she ain't nothin' but my cuddy
I can't wife no thot, suck my dick till she see snot, huh
Came from out the slums, fuck these thotties 'cause I'm hot
Hunnid round drum and I shot it on the spot
Codeine on her tongue 'cause I'm drinkin' syrup alot
Did a donut out the lot soon as I turned out the parkin' lot
I can't wife no thot, no, I can't wife no thot
I had bought some Cartiers 'cause that mouth there on lock
Gucci sock get Louis top, big chain made her pussy pop
Earrin' got her lashin' out, walkin' round like a rental cop
Checkin' bitches, they be on the 'Gram
Check her phone, I think she tryna scam
I ain't tryna save these hoes, no thank you, ma'am
I hit that nanny on green-green, swallow my cum, no ring-ring
Red Ferrari a mean ting, I got a mean ting
Came with her panties, I gave her some lean-lean
I gave her the clean-clean
She want that molly, I gave her a green bean
She took off her wing-wings
I had to put her inside of the Bentley thing
Fucked up her Maybelline
Maybe she think she more than what she is
Maybe she thinkin' queen
Maybe she think Civil gon' save her
Maybe she fuckin' 'round with the neighbors

I'm scarred for life, and fuck the hype I go hard for life
Ain't it precious, I'm thankful
For every second I'm in the leather room
My phone up, actin like a piston
You so caught in the present
You don’t wanna stay down for your prison
You bout that drama, drama, I want that llama, llama
Behind these raps behind that trap I ask my baby mama
Go see my vision, my dreams maybe too big for you
You better thank god everyday I had a kid by you

With a few scratches all I need is some green plastic

Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Verse 1]
Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First, I had bought a Bimmer, then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, 'cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today

Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes

Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice

If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
It's mafia all day

Murder in broad day, murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool in my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now

I like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch, you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make so much money, it's got me delirious
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious
I gotta maintain, I'm superior, nigga
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us

First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip got a whole lot of 30
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin'",Future,Jersey,

When they took him into custody, they took my life away

My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it

I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused

[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions, gotta play it foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, ""I'm tired now""
I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, ""Who done died now?""
Knowin' I'm involved, but we gon' slide back when it's dyin' down
I don't know who opps no more, you look crazy, I'm firin' rounds
I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothin' to the voice of the streets
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advise he died in his sleep
That's the trenches, yeah, yeah

Public conversation got you touchin' clouds
Popped the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation, waitin' for the trial (Ain't no visitation)
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child (Woah)
Real classy Jazzy, real don't do no trollin'
Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus

[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs, that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment, yeah

We can't even get no sleep behind this shit
You make a temporary decision
That cause permanent pain

You ran across my mind, and I ain't trippin'
[?] canary yellow birds are drippin' off me
I was young when I fucked with you
You wouldn't understand the person that I grown into
I put in overtime inside this vocal booth
It's amazing how crazy in love you wit' the kid
I used to hold you by your waist and you'd look up to the kid
You was out cryin', why you ridin' on the kid
We should've won an award off the movies that we did
We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing
I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen
We was friends before all of this
I wanna see you happy girl no matter who you're with
On some real shit...

I was taking out the limo thinking
How much you was there for me, I got you forever, wherever
That's just the man in me, I look at you like family
Wanna see how you been doin'
I turned you to a fucking beast
Remember how we ran the streets and fucked until we'd go to sleep
I know you ain't forgot that, I doubt that
Even though that nigga housed that, you still left yo heart back
I'mma wait for you to call back, I'mma fall back
I'm over that, yeah
Ay, let me reflect for a second

Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic

The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead and do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
I'm a Astronaut nigga better trust my pimping

Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Bimmer out of Germany
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You will re-appear and go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walking when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I was an Earthling now im SciFi
Wallah, I stay high
My bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And crawl out in that new Porsche",Future,Magic,

Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side

Young enough to still sell dope
But old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side

And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga

Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go

Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go

Technically I never packed up and leave
Left 80 racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know

She won't even get wet for you, for me she's swimming pool

I might put a flex on her, I’m talking tycoon

I be on the phone with Doe Boy, I be telling him
He inspired me to go harder
You know what I'm saying? Real talk
Will-Will-Will-William

[Verse 1]
My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went
Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
R.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me, would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here

[Interlude]
Monster, ah
Say I'm Illuminati
They tryna make me catch a body

[Verse 2]
I don't know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big Bank saying wipe a nigga's nose
My girl changed the lock on the doors
Said fuck that shit, poured up a four
Ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me?
That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
Put Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got lil' shawty with me, she a pro
Know she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spur wasn't tinted, I told 'em ain't got nothing to hide
Told 'em I'm through with the pies
Told 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write

We gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe saying we ain't falling off
I'm on loudest green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
They got a magazine with no vizine
Just riding around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In O-hi-o that's my shorty
We ain't playing around this dungarees
We gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me and then copy
They wasn't playing fair no no, oh no no, oh no no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell the coco you talking to popo
You know that's a no-no, you know that's a no-no
You know that's a no-no, no no no no no no
Came at the dopo serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch you stepping in no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-b-b-back with these stallions
Drink after drink, I just carry on
Got the sack on me now I just carry it
Got some m's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagon, 56 nights I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy
But I love it baby
When I jump out the whip when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter, in the sewer, the streets turn a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super that's young Super Future

​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind

But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied

And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt

I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me

Homie said ""go get the 'Rari""
I'ma get the yorki tomorrow
I get a yacht master, you get a yacht master
I treat you like you a model
We go to Turks, we can go to Aspen
Or we can go back to Cabo
If you been telling me personally girl look like you hit the lotto
One thing about it, don't lose your composure
Finish pilates and hop out the Rover
63 G-Wagon, I'm gettin' older
You get the full attention from my comrades and all my soldiers
Cartier down to the rocks
I got a key to your box
You got that chinchilla box
Meet me at the dealership box
All that drip drip drop
Make a nigga bands go pop
You get invited on a yacht
We making love on the spot
You throw Phillipe to the sky
Keep it elite for your guy
They can't speak to the pie
Make a nigga reach for the fire
Audemars, mi casa
Hear the hoes goin' bye bye
Can't fuck up my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't fuck up my time

Your job don't make up a dime to mines

Telling me yes brings out the best in me

Giving your pussy away girl is gon' fuck up my legacy

If everybody gotta get it they be up in it when they on the grind

Lamborghini, Bentley Coupe, Bentley, Rolls Royces
Gotta the way entourage attracts the task forces
Hand the kush out the DJ booth make it rain
If they find out we in, I might lose my chain
Things might change
Gave the waitress Ben Frank for a drank
She kept the change
Is he rapping? Is he trapping? Bitch, I'm in my own lane

Is you watching me preform or is you watching cause you copying
Try to convict me on the ice: I'm rocking
Could it be my ears
Man tell me what it is all these damn designer gear
I'm bout to stop rocking jewelry I can't tell who people is
Just by looking in the crowd you looking blurry over here
Something bout to happen in a minute I can't tell it
Something fishy going on X-Rayed and I smell it!

I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I know this cash rules
Everything around me turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold, I ain't got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down, ten toes, board the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time, the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like Roll Tide

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'

I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

[Verse 2]
Aquafina water got me glistenin'
When I whip that Bimmer, can't you picture me rollin'?
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy
Niggas tellin' lies, they so feminine
I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&M's
Fuck a 9 to 5, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin', do right, feel like I waited a lifetime
Weigh up both sides 'cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car a push start
I'm from the apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart

[Verse 1]
I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin’ through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn’t believe the half of me
Show and prove, don’t make believe
I’ll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Purer than the rawest coke
This ain’t no shit that I wrote
I’ve been down this road before
And I’ve been on the rollercoast’
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin’ like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' a life sentence and he died
While I’m on the road, doin’ shows, takin’ this ride
I just got word my uncle tried commit suicide
This the second time I’m goin’ back in, the second time
You’ll get a second chance at life, nigga I ain’t lyin’

[Verse 2]
I gots the homies, they could only mean the world to me
And they ain’t comin’ back home, they in the cemetery (rest in peace)
I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale
I know the kingpin’s on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain’t a Tyler Perry
This real rap, real life, it’s very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Wish I could stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil’ cousin caught a body and he’s still fightin’
And I got killaz walkin’ the yard, Future all they recitin’
And I can’t forget you niggas did too much biting
But I ain’t gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type

[Verse 3]
I take a trip, unwrap a gift, run ithere like Emmit Smith
Go to New York with this gift and I come back with a lick
Break bread with my team
Partner money here, here
I ain't come for this, I want my music global
I wanna see people pump their fist
I’m gonna change a nigga life
So he ain’t gotta go through this
Don’t get caught in my fit
Till I’m runnin’ 1 0 6
They tracked me ‘cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fold
No snitches allowed, case closed

[Chorus]
Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy
Ran it up and gave 'em a sad face
Now anywhere around the globe
You rep the gang and you got rank, yeah
Gotta converse with the manager
When I walk inside the bank, yeah
Who would ever think they was sleepin' on me?
Goyard with a half a million on me
R&D's, it's like I'm possessed
All these diamonds on my chest

[Verse]
Sleepin' on the floor had made my heart colder
They try to make it hard for me, I never falter
Gotta say I'm good, I'm on the ESPY's
I made millions by the day, check my chest piece
Try to take care of my family the best I know how
Bought myself a mansion, now I gotta buy everybody a house
Takin' care of my bitches like the mother of my child
God know all my brothers sin, I gotta blow this trial
You don't get no guidance out the trenches to make it out
God knows I'll never give up on you, never will
Shit gettin' hectic with the niggas that ya kill for
Money got me hesitant, what I got to live for?
All this fame gettin' terrible
All these rings and Berettas
Flawless victory, change the weather
Hurricane, natural disaster
Pour the lean for the bastards
Take the jet across the atlas
God I pray I forget my dada
'Cause I didn't grow up to be average
All the times he lied to me, ya gave up on my arteries
I was such a worried child, just wanted you to be a part of me
Fishscale projects made a man out me
Sleepin' on the carpet made a man out me
Full of medication, I wouldn't change it
I was once broke but no complainin'
I finally start to embrace that I'm famous
It's hard for me to erase when I was nameless

Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy
Ran it up and gave 'em a sad face

Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looked that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't really tryin'
I ain't really tryin'

[Verse 1]
I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

[Verse 2]
It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

[Verse 3]
Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, hope you ain’t get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy
Mami Israeli (Mami Israeli)

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way

Lets go play by the sea
Pick the brauds you can see
I like them Tory Birch that fashion and how they complement your feet
You so bossy you a boss
Bruh she shitting on Kelis
These niggas wanna drop the bands, And all she wants is me
Lets go lay up in a suite
Lets go sweep you off your feet
Lets go take a shopping spree
You like Fendi? (?)
You ain't fucking with BeBe
You look better in CC
I can spot you across the street
The way you stand is so unique

Fuck what you thank about it you think its wrong
You politicians politicin’ about niggas getting it
Making niggas successful you tryna make niggas stressful
Its a side of me to be a hot commodity
Fuck a robbery I take them on violently
For biting me I should sent my whole army
For making futuristic sounds so corny

Got a chain hangin' over me

Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me

Tell me them lies that you want me to hear

Keep that strap and that tooly, cause I know it ain't safe
Smokin on Cush, tryna make that pain go away
Throwin money, cause it can be seen falling from our face
You can see it, comin down my eye
So I had to let the money fly
Couldn’t see it comin down my eye, so I had to let the money cry

Grapes and strawberries, nothing's contemporary

Rockstar in this shit, like a popstar in this shit, yeah
Tryna forget the way they did to Bankroll Fresh, gettin' harder
Seen his son at my little boy birthday party, it was harder
The streets of the ATL don't respect nothin' but shottas
Had to look the other way, could be the other way
Hit Yung Mazi up, that was in the broad day
I popped two Xans and I been sleep all day

I was lettin' the shit I can't control destroy me
Everything's too deep for you, my nigga, pardon me

Maybe my mind playin' tricks on me (Maybe my mind)

On dirty sprite forever

If you wanna live better

Twenty chains on my neck, man, they can't figure me out
Put a Rollie 'round my neck, they try and figure me out
They 'bout to gas up the jet, they try and figure me out
I had to get some more Fugazi, they tryna figure me out

She ain't leave when I was broke

She ain't leave when I was broke

I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
That I change up your location
That I pull up in that Wraith
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now
We doin' Cali right now (without a doubt)

I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft
You better turn your back right now
Ain't no turnin' back right now
I can't let you cramp my style
If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl
Stand right back 'cause you lookin' like coward
You end up stiff, sleepin' with the flowers (ditch)

I was raised up where them wolves at, slung dope where them killas hung
My auntie's house was a dope house and I slung dope in my longjohns
My grandma seen me bust a plate, put 30 stacks on 4 squares
C Dub doin' 15, got out, doin' another 25
Got the lean molly look in my eyes, got blood and sweat in my eyes
5D, my phone i, makin' lots of money on my own time
Hard times inspired me, concrete, that lion turf
45, my iron work, I'm a real nigga, that's after birth
Astronaut, and that's after Earth, Scientology, Tom and Kate
And I know I can whip a cake, and I seen niggas infiltrate
This fly shit they try to confiscate, as I sit back and I meditate
I'm top dog and I'm emperor, all dogs gon' go to heaven
Ridin' round with my mac-11, all these bitches swallowin'
Take a crew to the other side, bad bitch, she bisexual
A bad bitch with a bad bitch, gone off these Franklins
Gone off these Franklins, yeah gone off these Franklins

Aye where the hook at, my nigga?
I used to cook up them cookies and I ain't look back my nigga
It's a crook in me, nigga
Lord I'm prayin' for my demons, MDA in my semen
I was talkin' to God the other day, swear I was leanin'
God forgive me, forgive me, Oh no I didn't do it
But just go right in the booth, and spit my heart and my anger
My closest friends givin' up, man they feelin' like strangers
I got my whole crib plush, with guns like a ranger
You gotta take me on a high speed chase before you catch me
You either live, you either die, that's the only way you'll get me
Aww man, aww man, I should have stayed at Columbia High
It was times that I thought ""What I'm thinkin', like why
I am who I am?"" and shit I can't cry
I was built for this lifestyle, damn, honestly
From the gutter travelin' to another country
All kings need to be crowned, that's my pedigree
