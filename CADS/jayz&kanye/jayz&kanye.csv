[Intro: Kanye West]
Turn my headphones up, louder, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Sample: James Brown]
What you need, what–what you need
I got what you need, what–what you need (Bam)
What you need, what–what you need
I got what you need

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Jay-Z]
Hello, hello, hello, hello, white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony, or who gon' try to embarrass ya?
I'ma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
'Cause I’m richer, and prior to this shit, was movin' free base
Had a conference with the DJs (Yeah?), Puerto Rico three days
Poli with the PDs, now they got our shit on replay
Sorry I’m in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Ain’t that where the Heat play? (Yeah)
Niggas hate ballers these days (Yeah)
Ain’t that like LeBron James?
Ain’t that just like D-Wade? Wait

[Sample: James Brown]
What you need, what–what you need
I got what you need, what–what you need (Bam)
What you need, what–what you need
I got what you need (Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Wussup, wussup, wussup, wussup
Wussup, muh'fucka? Where my money at?
You gon' make me come down to your house where yo' mommy at
Mummy wrap the kids, have ‘em cryin’ for they mommy back
Dummy that your daddy is, tell 'em I just want my racks
Racks on racks on racks (Racks!)
Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs
Who in that? Oh shit, it’s just blacks on blacks on blacks
Hunnid stack–How you get it? Nigga layin’ raps on tracks
I wish I could give you this feeling, I’m planking on a million
I’m riding through yo' hood, you can bank I ain’t got no ceiling
Made a left on Nostrand Ave., (Right), we in Bed Stuy
Made a right on 79th, I’m coming down South Shore Drive
I remain Chi-town, Brooklyn ‘til I die

[Outro: James Brown]
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
I got what you need, what–what you need
Take ‘em on home
What you need, what–what you need
I got what you need, what–what you need
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
Tryna hurt my name, huh?",JAY-Z & Kanye West,Gotta Have It,
"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This the new crack, on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me, ""You back!""
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way, nigga, you should fucking quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you, motherfucker, and I get it, haha
No paper, ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going H·A·M, nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, why I have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn, a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been moved
I swam waters with Great Whites
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like, ""Really: half a billi nigga, really?"" You got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
With my nephew die, daddy's dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother, pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Comme des Garçons, fuck yo' fresh
Head shots, nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork
Peace, God, 'cause you know a nigga just went

[Hook: Jay-Z]
H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go H·A·M

1985 white Lamborghini Countach, two of 'em

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero, a whole lot of Os
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah, you after money
Bulletproof condom when I'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why? Fuckin' centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on, feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blur on
Too close, you comatose, so dope, you overdose
Get back, you overclose, oh no
The hood was strugglin' but then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold, bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand-dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

[Bridge: Jay Z & Kanye West]
Take it how you want 'til a nigga dead
'Til then, I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, hol' up

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
Eleven in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga, I got five more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building, now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah, it's like the Beatles back
Bey-Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih-Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building, we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas' fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie, let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see it, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols, serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste, you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga, never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learnt that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova, this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like

[Chorus: Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey

I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, ""You going to school, I’ll give you a summer""
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later, she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
And I’m rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy
I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
Downtown, mixing fabrics, tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic, uh
A million hits and the web crashes, damn
South Park had 'em all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin', uh
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain’t no fashion show, mothafucka, we live it

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don’t wake Nana
Built a republic that still stands
I’m tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up Yaya?
What’s that smell? Oh, I’m just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner

Uh, bloody murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Paper read: ""Murder, black-on-black murder""
Paper read: ""Murder, black-on-black murder"" again

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Uh, this is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I’m out here fighting for you, don’t increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I’m from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn! I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read: ""Murder, black-on-black murder""
The paper read: ""Murder, black-on-black murder"" again
""Murder"" again

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain’t got enough room for all the tombs
It’s a war going on outside we ain’t safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I’m out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it’s all black, uh, I love us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read: ""Murder, black-on-black murder""
The paper read: ""Murder, black-on-black murder"" again

[II. ""Excellence""]

[Interlude: Jay Z]
It’s a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Huh, yeah, uh

[Verse 5: Jay Z]
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I’m present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I “shh-shh”
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go, uh
What’s up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain’t enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I’m all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Yeah, it’s all messed up when it’s nowhere to go
So we won’t take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G’s, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG’s
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What’s the life expectancy for black guys?
The system’s working effectively, that’s why
I’ll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause ain’t nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain’t nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let’s savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours",JAY-Z & Kanye West,Murder to Excellence,

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks

You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some

No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read ""No Apologies""
The other said ""Love is Cursed by Monogamy""
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach

It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m 'bout to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450, I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never going to jail

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I made Jesus Walks, I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermès of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showing off
I'm done, I'll hit you up maña...nah!

[Verse 5: JAY-Z]
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubanos with Castro in cabanas
Viva México, cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can’t you see we gettin' money up under you?

[Verse 6: Kanye West, Jay-Z & Both]
Can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker read: ""What would Hova do?""
Jay is chillin' (Uh), Ye is chillin' (Uh)
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne

We in the time of our lives, baby
Turn the music up, primetime

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Uh, yeah, primetime, beat by Dion
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, 40-year-old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42, be better than 24s
I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23s, they can't fuck with the boy
As far as them 16s, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that six-deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
I started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for CÎROC to give Puff's stocks a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontainebleau
A case of Ace... make it two
Nigga, we rollin', beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do? Ooh

Ooh, the night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
'Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn, Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib, so mine better be prime
Niggas gon' kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first-class flight
I'm tripping on it, socks on marble floors, I'm slipping on it
Champagne, I'm sipping on it, shit tastes different, don't it?
You know what? You right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
""When you coming home?"" That's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that and doesn't laugh?

It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's 'yacht'
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money, I put Monie in the middle
Where she at? In the middle

Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her
That's right, nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she is quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain’t got nothing on Willona
Don’t make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Penélope and Salma in it, uh
Back to my Beyoncés
You deserve three stacks, word to André
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums
You belong in vintage clothes crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
Get ya own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake, only for my man’s sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will
If I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel

Naw, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, ""Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?""

A bad bitch, and a bag of weed: the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life’s cursed? Well, mine’s an obscenity

I’m losing myself, I’m stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
