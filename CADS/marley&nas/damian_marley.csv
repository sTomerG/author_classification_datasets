"[Intro]
Well all me don't love is the people weh fight 'gainst me
Me don't love dem, but me enjoy dem because me cyan sit dung
And think of dem and write music bout dem...

[Hook]
I see 10,000 chariots
And they are going without horses
Hey, the riders them cover them face
So you could not make them out in smoky place
It's a musical stampede
It's a musical stampede
It's a musical stampede
Whoa saying it's a musical stampede

[Verse 1]
Lord, dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Yey, dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Me nah go put no triple six inna mi head you must be mad
One day me must have to dread you mus si fool
Me a run the whole place red and me tell dem
From now otherwise me will never beg bread
Dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Yey, dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lord, dem gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Yey, dem gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Thru me nah follow dem system
Dem mek a big ting
And nuff a dem, a just wolf in sheep clothing
But Rome a go bun down
Inna di hot sun
And then the wicked and the Eden dem fun dun
Them making miscalculation
No hesitation
Them mek it sound like I and I praise Satan
Who is dem to pass judgement
And dem no reverend
And Raggamuffin say him nah keep silent

[Bridge]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
People ride on, ride, ride on
People ride on, ride, ride on
People ride on, ride, ride on
People ride on, ride, ride on
Ride on...

[Verse 3]
Dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Yey, dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Me nah go put no triple six inna mi head you must be mad
One day me must have to dread you mus si fool
Me a run the whole place red and me tell them
From now otherwise me will never beg bread
Dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war
Yey, dem bwoy gwaan until dem gwaan too far
Till dem start up the revolution and the war

[Outro]
We cyaan tell the woman from the man
They are dressed in the same pollution
Their minds is confused with confusion
So to their problems seems there's never no solution
Dem a night life ravers
Dem a midnight ravers",Damian Marley,"10,000 Chariots",
"[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Well now she call me on the phone and said she's home alone
And she want me to come over and make her house a home
Well I gave it to her once, and I liked how she responds
Well now I'm in trouble

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
It seems she need to oil her spine
Tell all a gyal toast bread can't build di putty gold mine
Need all di doctor fish with di essential slime
She tell me she want to signal the plane 'n time mi want slow wine
Turn on di HBO she want fi watch showtime
Give her di cordless microphone, she want di one with line
Seem like me and this young gyal ya just can't combine
So it's sour like lime
Running it down the line, Mr Muffin one time

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
She call mi pon di I 95
How mi ah tek so long she ah wonder which car mi drive
Tired fi listen album now and she want me live
Tell me she want fi come knock her out till she can't revive
SO!Ah so my planet and the stars align
She tell me she want me know which part her hills and valley dem join
Seh she want me ride her like a Ferrari sign, put appointment aside
Nothing can't compromise fi di vibes I provide

[Bridge: Stephen Marley]
It's alright
She wants my loving all night
When she get's it she's all right
She wants my loving all night, ay

[Verse 4: Damian Marley]
I should make no physical contact
Tell her fi hold it down and still she just can't quiet
Seh mi take her up and tun her maniac, tellin me dat I compliment her natural habitat
WELL. . . It seem like she deaf or she blind
Want come step inna mi life when time she deh far behind
Want mi play her rhythm till di tape want rewind
And she nah watch no time
And she just nah resign
Till she see the sun shine",Damian Marley,All Night,Stephen Marley
"[Intro: Damian Marley]

Now greetings to the world
The accumulated intelligence of mankind
Is what makes us special among all other species
Everything is built upon the foundation before it

[Hook: Damian Marley]
These ancient thoughts
This ancient love
These ancient hearts
These ancient souls
These ancient songs
These ancient people

These ancient thoughts
This ancient love
These ancient hearts
These ancient souls
These ancient hopes
These ancient people

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Like the earth, and the sky
And the sea, and the birds
And the trees, and the sun
Melody
Like a mountain, like a valley
Like the river, like the lake
Like the earth, when it quakes
Space and sea

[Verse 1: Nas]
This is rock and roll meets aristotle
I fly those G5's through the skies to Cabbo
Martial arts more ancient than Tae Bo
Swordsman, more ancient than Zorro
Ancient like the pharohs or priests of Yoruba
Or Obeah euphobia you peril
Your paths narrow like climbing mount Kilimanjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddeled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camo-flage
Chief before sarge, or lieutenant
Village elders before the senate
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st amendment
In the beginning, the drum was the text sending
There was moons before months, and time before minutes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
From love, onto language, onto hieroglyphics
The Invention of the wheel, onto mathematics
The almanac, the calender, onto geographics
Herbal medicine, to anti-biotic Ginseng to acetonic
Water pump, water pump, to onto hydrolics
Moonlight, candle light, onto electronics
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college
Oh, all of These ancient thoughts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Junior Reid]
Man a Bust the earth, man a Bust the sky
Junior Gong, and Junior Reid we meditation it so high
Man a trod the gravel, it dirty and it dry
Oh, dem no see no wings, but man a fly
Babylon fi splurt, dem no know what life is worth
Oh, tell dem stop polluting mother earth
Man a make a trot, me robe, me sandles and me rod
Dem shouldve known, hear say man this man a God

And when me take control the gal head swell
I care less the morning a my love zone
And when me take control the gal stop roam
I care less me share from a Brazil well, and when me take control

Well I man said baby you got me going up and down

Like an old soldier me a patrol the town
Keep enough queen and me a no wear one crown
And if you no see me then me gone underground
Too much panty moan up upon me compound
Gal a you me love but it is not you alone
Jamming jamming, making I your back bone
Jamming jamming, making on me back bone

Could you be loved and be loved (x2)

Do you receive the message I'm sending
Do you hear ya hear about the guineas I'm lending
Where you hear about all the time we're spending
Do make sure there's no wrong corner bending
Well, things are looking splendid
All of my Guiness and me peanuts blended
And you have received the messages I've sended
It's Rastafari name defended

Well its no co-inky-dinky;
Oh so much young gal come to lick me
Jenday ragamuffin feel a pound a stinky
Even one good spliff off a the sweet life twinkie
Well buildings need expanding
To meet the supplies where the fans demanding
I Jr. Gong microphone commanding
There'll be no clearance for landing
Well you miss teeny tiny
Will you please undo the bikini kindly
Well she must a come from a wine refinery
And get bless with the pretty gold minery

Oh its junior, he's a skanking
Oh they make me feel like a real top ranking
Better yell a new bally boot we’re spanking
Well you better watch how you ride your banking

Well...

My love, beautiful. Here we go

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
And I remember when we met and we began dating, and everything was copacet' and we began mating
And the way then the way mi love her good, she gimme don ratings
Because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
And she get her belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings, and the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now it typically become an everyday thing, regulary physically communitcating
Sexually, scientifically penetrating, until she start spiritually resonating
Ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
She is the only Queen the King is desognating, I know it's kinda deep but keep on concentrating
Cause jazzy lay di beat and I am clearly stating

"[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
She said she's born to be wild and she can't be tamed
And all she wants in life is fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving, moving right along
Even though she knows deep down inside she knows something is wrong

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
No idle jubee dem couldn't, cotch pon my pillow
Weh a love man for nike an ah love man for fila
Dat's not the ways of ancient war gorilla
Me rather den to save all my sasaparilla
On a lonesome breezy sunday morning
This maiden came to town
Me have to blick a sound
How she so cute and plus so sexy and so round
Sunlight catch her skin and lord it good from head to ground
Next candidate me see wh fit, fi wear mi crown
And such tender smiles amaze me
The way that she looks on the night
She should be having my baby, my baby
The pleasure was all mine
Like yesterday news it's only for a time
Always on the go because she live a life ah crime
She don't want no man fi mind it
Di Muffin say dat he couldn't believe
I was living so blindly

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
She said she's born to be wild and she can't be tamed
And all she wants in life is fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving, moving right along
Even though she knows deep down inside she knows something is wrong

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Well no Shandy, stricktly imported tequila
Vintage brandy, skunk sensemilia
Rubies and roses, diamond collar
Never check me for a money nor a penny nor a dollar
She can't go to London without visa
Me can't build me spliff dem without rizzla
Dem say look out the door and you know di weather
Me start put two an two together
First class flights and she drinks the most expensive wines
When she can't maintain her lifestyle up on the minumum wages
She needs the coil and just like a stubborn mule
I would tell that is all she's worth
Well tha smuggling and trafficking of ilegal substances is her line of work
Me say a good woman ration
Most of di gyal dem get so caught up inna fashion
Love vanity dem seem dem love it with a passion
Start to used dem body for some dirty profession
Seem like dem need spiritual supervision
Ital craft and a ital vision
Righteous path and a righteous decision
Instead of di materialistic religion
Else there's gonna be a crash course and collision

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
She said she's born to be wild and she can't be tamed
And all she wants in life is fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving, moving right along
Even though she knows deep down inside she knows something is wrong

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
Well the it's all history
Me go up on a ends fi chack a one jubilee
Di way she rub me down and make me feel so nice
Me say haffi left and go ah studio go voice
Ariana please stay home tonight
Ariana please don't take that flight
Smuggling di drugs weh dem supply to di poor
Destruction of my people well then she's got to go
Tell her nah fi mix up inna those things no more
Ariana never mixed up those drugs before
She said she want fi go up on a smuggling tour
She missing gangsta parcel dem say her skull fi bore
She don't have all di dollars weh fi ever the score
But she wanna run her own drug store

''The security of the world
Those who disturb (terrorise) the peace at this time
We are going to describe them now''

[Bunny Wailer dialogue]
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of ONE LOVE
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars...
SELAH!

And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause

And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause
Dem inna dem churches tryin to save... saviours

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
SEE IT DEH NOW...Hey!
Now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the skies over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up
Searching for the sign and the sign is us
Searching for the truth all you find is us
Searching for the troops still behind is us
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach building boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you Tell-Lie-Vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up
And who calling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down...

Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl
Institute of the church in war
Preaching and researching war
Practice and rehearsing war
Teaching and dem learning war
Instigating and urging war
Always keep alert in war
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds in war
And the freaks and nerds in war
And the straight and curves in war
Forward and reverse in war

"[Intro: Bunny Wailer]
Hear this three monkeys sitting under a coconut tree (really?)
Discussing things as they are said to be
Said one to the others, now listen you two
There’s a strange rumor that can’t be true
They say man was descended from our noble race
But the very idea is a big disgrace
No monkey ever deserted his wife
Or her baby, to ruin their lives
Yeah The monkeys drift is mine (that’s right)

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
Well educated fools they have ruined di world
And start make it hard for both di boys and di girls
Dem steal all di Africans diamonds and pearls
And start bank it up inna federal reserves
And then Rasta fuck it up and insight riot
Warn dem fi cool and we did warn dem fi quiet
Now dem hear the kick drum di snare and di hi hat
Load up dem belly with some copper shot diet

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Imagine after so much chanting and prayers
But a revolutionary situation requires
Mi fi come tear off unno face wid pliers
Surround dem ends wid all some burning tires
Round up dem friends and put dem pon trials
Until dem send di reparation dollars
Warning to all di political scholars political thieves and political liars
Political cocaine and gun suppliers
Di whole a dem a go down inna flames and fires
Well unno better fly out like some frequent fliers
Bound to feel the wrath of di real Bongonyahs
Hey don't fuck yourself next time you read out di budget
Di government case, ah poor people a judge it
Dem bring di guns but di youths dem ah bust it
Bun dem skeletons weh lock up inna closet
Wipe out dem species and all dem inhabits
With a warm series of pain and havoc
Nah clean no feces fi money prefer grab it
Dem mek mi resort to violence di race get lead up
Somebody nah live up
Somebody goin dead up BLOW!!
Whole ah di garment dem red up BLOW!!
Car and apartment get bled up
Didn't you get ample warning say poor people fed up
And still every morning
Dem try hold dem head up
Emperor Selassie calling
Youths dem fi dread up
Babylon is fallen
Gun nozzle bend up
Releasing di whole of di youth dem weh pen up

Minutes after minutes I say hour after hour
All dem shady people dem nasty and sour
This is warlord style me as black noah
'Cause I represent black power
Well, almighty God inna da statue a tower
A long time me know some more did come to devour
They have me people dem and shout power and shower
And trick them with them rice and flour ya know

Dem fi no say poor people, on a boat can’t no row a
Fire a flame me bring fi ya ya drug for ya
And that me want the whole of them fi know ya

[Verse 4: Treach]
Well I heard that man came from sands and other molecules
Way before bodies and barbecues
With a good side a bad side and still argue too
Before schemin and thievin and dreamin of gleamin and feenin
Even before Adam and Eve and even
Before it was about being the nicest or whose diamonds that are priceless
B.C. around Tutankhamun and Isis
On the continent of Africa
Pass out and tribes to create a character
Sold us shit on earth was magical
Then the strangers came from the boat with the ropes
Chains that felt strange, they called it the slave game
The game changed
They had shackled like assholes
The Bloodclot
So nowadays the way we prevent it is a thugs Glock
Seen them rape and kill our children and women
The villain the bill gonna sort the black man how to kill men
Let’s keep it real man
You can’t harm me or scar me
Respect for me History’s priority with the Marleys",Damian Marley,Educated Fools,"Bunny Wailer, Treach"
"Oh, no no, no
This is bad
This is real

Now I see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
Miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
Strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will obey me
Future for the babies, hopes for the babies
Tomorrow for the babies, no sorrow for the babies
Babies having babies, raising our babies
All of these young ladies give them thanks and praises
How long can she take it?
Dreams are full of maybes Will she ever make it?
Hustles on a daily, in the club a shake it
Strip down 'til she naked, don't ever mistake it
Much too real to fake it, need it then she'll take it
She'll do it for the babies, a mother's love is sacred
Now you don't ever fail me

A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring…

Is there no other option than adoption for you babies
You're raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
Strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will obey me
Cowards play the game thing, Fathers do the brave thing
And that's participating
He keeps on concentrating
There is no debating
No running away thing
A new life is awakening
From his ejaculating
It's in the oven baking
Takes two for the making
He's right there through the cravings
And early morning waking
School and educating
Sports and recreating, Karate and ballet thing
Teenager of today thing
Fathers still relating, Still communicating
And they'll always embrace him
Cause they cannot replace him

A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
Cause they cannot replace him
A child needs loving, caring…

And always do your best to keep a promise to your babies
And if you can't be good at least be honest to your babies
The strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will obey me
History of the babies
Beginning of the ages
You're flipping through the pages
And up and through the 80's
Some are gang related, Drug affiliated
Some intoxicated
Headed for the snake pit
And Papa's locked in cages
And Mama's lacking wages
And this is what they're faced with
Upon a daily basis
Bleaching out dem faces
Running from dem races
Shooting up dem places
Killing other babies
As bitter as the taste is
And words cannot explain it
Just walk the narrow pavement
And speak of love not hatred",Damian Marley,For the Babies,

Rollin' up, roll like we thunderous
Somkin' up, Rasta not sprinkle dust
Too much ecstasy, make manna exit us
Too much fantasy, here upon next to us
Fit in ganja weed, always notorious
Sucker censor me, if you feel glorious
We have weed in our cakes and Oreo's
Believe me though, death upon your Marlboro
You want my roll, on someone you hardly know
This Marley grow, no time to move feet
Make it slow, you tellin' me no

Like cool, Johnny Depp and you want to blow
You shot, direct; that means you are far bellow
You start to take, substances up in your nose

And can't give no answer when di poor people cry
We get ignorant, we binghi drum dem go rise
Gimme some space so I can bun those guys
Well then, most politicians fighting gainst Rasta troops
And making mistake and a tell poor people, ""Oops""
See dem a see dem a flex, like some dapa's and doops
Gimme some space to bun di nincompoops
Why should ghetto youths dem have to war over cheese
Wid these big machines that you bring from over seas?

Gimme some space so I can bun dem please
Well den a big fire stick weh all a mek certain sound
Pure gun shot me here a ring thru the town
Everybody wanna be the modern day Al Capone
Gimme some space so I can bun dem down
Di youths dem a jump to every word that you said
When gunshot a bust well fi you pickney nuh dead
Dem vex true we hail King Selassie instead
Gimme some space and mek I burn dem red
Well nuff gyal a say dem want fi come a stage show

How di youths find roof to live under in
And shine like a diamond twinkling
When they see me and di gyal dem mingling
Better watch how you group and singling
Better mind who you feel and fingling
We don't join goose and gandering
We don't join chumpas squandering
And the sound of the album cramping him
Well we don't play game when dem ramping in
Better watch as my timb boots stomping in

Di camp dem camping in
And ah burn out the vampire vamping in
Wi di, red burning lamp within
After so much sleep and slumbering
It's now wonder di impress dumping him
Youngest veteran will be pumping in
Thumping in, the club dem jumping in
So wah, tell the people your bumpin in
Say wah, all mi colleagues dem chumping in
After sleepless nights of sampling
The results can be life gambling
Now don't stop by nor stumble in

Someone cookie jar will be crumbling
And we don't mek room fi no fumbling
Well, careful how your entire in
Certain after dark adventuring
Cause you might have to be surrendering

When the real Gideon is untangling
And a drive inna prestige handling
And a practice punk dismantling
And a trod go a Binghi di thanks giving
Fi go hail up di elders skankin in
Fi guidance you thru the world weh di punks live in
Burn the church weh di popes and monks live in
Well judgment fi dem tampering

Grown folks slackness
Big woman hotness
Watch it mek me knock this
Experienced fatness
Love it how mi lock this
Gong to the Zilla
I'm a monsta like a Loch Ness
Look how long my locs is
All bills paid, all bets made
House well clean, all bugs sprayed
Vacation tripping, she ain't tripping
Island skipping, fine wine sipping
Gourmet cooking, no Facebooking
Nothing to see 'cause she ain't looking
Tag team masseuses, D Brown's music
Natural juices, so therapeutic
Lips on my earlobe, softer than a q-tip
Getting kinda stony, actin' kinda stupid
Pretendin' we're in highschool, kissing at the movies

So do your grown an' sexy, baby 'cause you're awesome
See some likkle young girls, don' beg you no pardon
Teach 'em how to walk it, welcome dem to stardom

There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off

Early mornin' wake-up, bringin' me the papers
Continental breakfast, smoked salmon an' capers
The eggs are over easy, you're puttin' on your makeup
We do some exercises, strolling through the acres
A mansion out in Gables, cottage in the Naples
Fingles out in Bordeaux, horses in the stables
Baby we're connected, like tv is to cable
Like paper is to staple, like syrup is to maple
If Madonna's like a virgin, age is just a number
So tired of searching, gimme weh me come fah
She feelin' kinda naughty, I'm feelin' kinda rumpish
She is my accomplice, we're gettin' things accomplished
Call ya by your last name, tell ya that you're gorgeous
When I get around you I'm nervous till I'm nauseous
Tell me what's the holdup, baby 'cause I'm anxious
Both of us are grownups, drop your drawers to ankles

There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow up
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of

Two sides to a coin
And one must chose which side they join
You know?

Yeah
And meanwhile one man's meal
Is another man's poison
Mankind will do what they must to survive
Innit

Hear me now

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
In a gunman world
Any night him clock in at work
Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull
The magazine inna the two Glock full
And he's watching as the days go by
And he's counting as his peers all die
Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest
So he never gets a good night's rest
And then he's cranky in the morning times
And more victims have to lose their lives
The community a twist and twirl
Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world

In a gunman life
He might not come home from work one night
So every minute matter
Ignores advice
From his weeping baby mother and child
That he won't win every game he plays
So she know he'll meet his end one day
Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe
And have to take another gunman's life
What if a backstabber names his price
And how ironic if him dead from knife
The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy
Job description: kill and destroy

[Refrain: Damian Marley]
Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Well in a gunman world
Life is so stressful
Back to school time come
'cuz when a gunman work
If he is successful
And the job is well done
Then there will be an unsolved crime
With no one to fill out all blank line
John Public haffi hear and deaf
Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff
Does he get nervous just like you and I?
Watching out if the police pass by
'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail
Then it's either dead house or jail
What will it cost to make a gunman rich?
How many lives before a gunman switch?
The truth me want the youth them stop ignore
Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh

[Refrain: Damian Marley]
Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next one fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
And when a gunman makes choice
I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind
And does a gunman think twice?
Before him takes another someone's life?
I wonder what it is a gunman say
To the Father when a gunman pray
Does he kiss his kids to bed at night?
Making sure the blanket tucked just right?
Nothing no scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no

Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no

[Refrain: Damian Marley]
Can you tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?

You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years

[Chorus]
(Here.. here I come again)

It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

[Verse 2]
Man a wah do some likkle bomboclaated
Weh feel like them big 'cause dem album charted
Well all bad card will be disregarded
No punk cyaan finish weh what Bob Marley started
Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted
Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage
With Jah by my side I've got all advantage

[Chorus]
(Here.. here I come again)

Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

[Verse 3]
So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh

[Verse 4]
Me do a thousand video shooting, ten thousand chariot
Hundred thousand photo shoot and million radio drop
Mi deejay til' me hoarse a welcome people to the rock
You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap
Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop
Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap
Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map
Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop
My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac
First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths
The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks
I'm a veteran, the youngest to be exact
Ghetto people love me bad, I'm guessing opposites attract
Uptown me born and grow, Stony Hill to mark the spot

"[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than the knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh
Is not the ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jheri curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your body’s just a vehicle
Transporting yo' soul
It's what’s inside ah people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll

And love is in the presence of the love maker

And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer

A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all begot
Lessons that you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins

[Verse 4: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker

And I'm never crucify as nuh savior
Elect off himself inna the ruler

Me think me wanna lick upon shots
Upon a bloodclot
And fill the block with bumbaraas cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And
Before another brother's in chalks And
I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott-free
So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars
Storm upon mi prada
Watch a bomb holla
Watch 'im run, hit the floor
Told I'm come, come no
Throw ya ganja pon de air

So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road, miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic, and always be aware
The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion, can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

"[Verse 1]
An angel told me Jah is hearing our prayer each day
Regardless of our faith
And even though so many of his children stray
Our good deeds are never wasted
And so believe it or not you're special in your own way
And your existence is a must
Within the heart of Jah everyone has their space
Even the dogs have a purpose

[Chorus]
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves

[Verse 2]
Then I said, ""Angel, the world is such an ugly state
How will we make it out?
Man and woman seem to suddenly have lost their way
Our little hearts are full of hatred
Now it appears that we're way in over our heads
And we're in dire need of help
'Cause there's no way that we can right all these wrongs by ourselves""
The angel only said:

[Chorus]
Man, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
So feel good about yourself
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
Oh always be proud of yourself

[Verse 3]
Then I said, angel, the people are consumed by sin
And we no longer love His laws
A generation that's all but forgotten 'bout Him
Rebels without a cause
The angel told me the judgment we face is writ
Only if we choose to believe it
Jah love us all too much to ever let us burn in hell
They had to keep that one a secret

[Chorus]
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving mankind
Feel good about
Oh looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourself, no
Oh looks are deceiving you
Always be proud of yourself
'Cause looks are deceiving you
Don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh looks are deceiving you
Please feel good about yourself, yeah
Oh looks are deceiving you
Don't you underrate yourself, no
Looks are deceiving mankind
Don't you underrate
Don't you give up on yourself
Please don't you give up on yourselves, no
Now don't you give up on yourself
Oh don't you give up on

And say she loves my culture, herbs and locks
Silkly smooth way of I flow

She's hoping we can spend a night at
Somewhere that's warm and cozy, why not
She's been wanting me since my Karl Kani drop
And she needs the substance, not the hype chat
For dark clouds do bring rain, baby

And it was just a loan they're only sitting in
And when the king come home well what a bitter thing
Nashing of teeth and moaning upon bickering
Well mind you catch the flow it can be sickening
Only a few are chosen for the reckoning
It's Rastafari's world that unno living in
And it's a lion's jungle unno visiting
I know you've seen the posters of my images
Upon your streets and close to all your villages
My metaphors unfolding with my similies

And leave them lonely, feeling only pain
Cause your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

Rasta works a manifest, and it a blossom and a bloom
Nature always run its course, the tide is rising with the moon
It only takes a spark to put a fire to the fume
What is hidden in the dark shall be revealed so very soon
Tell Pharaoh free the prisoners from the dungeons and the doom
Tell the youths fi natty dread, and Babylon put dem in a platoon
The trials and the perils deeper than the blue lagoon

Blessed be the man weh hair natty, nappy, and grown
Blessed be the herbs weh keep we higher, nappy, and stone
Fire fi a man weh sit down inna Babylon's throne

And all the wasted love that has been lost has not been found

And it sounds so good to me, woah
Big skunky blunt a blaze and plus

I glance over just so I could see her
But my locks got in the way

Cool breeze a blow thru the weeping willow
She always leave a fragrance on my pillow
When I'm ready she will always follow
Me to the place of my old sleepy hollow
Soft silky voice is so sacred and hollow
Cause out spoken noisy streams run shallow
Reach to the stars when I launch the Apollo
Could a land up ah Sao Paulo

Oh you and I, a world apart
Please let me know, if I have your heart
Cause every time I'm with ya

They say it's all a mistake
They say I'm no good for you
They say you're too good for me

Your mama told you to be
A very good behaving
And now just because of me
They say you're misbehaving
Dad is not talking to you
Because he doesn't approve

And now they want her to hate

She's excited for life
Is she reckless at heart

Well baby it's you and me
We're painting portraits of love
Why won't they let us be free
And just let God be the judge
They've never been so ashamed
We've never been so in love
I'd rather hold on to you
They'd rather hold on to grudge
It's always been me and them
It's always been you and I
They taught us live and let live
They'd rather live and let die
I pray they live to forgive
And I say baby don't cry.......
Cause when it's all said and done
And man a shed flesh and bone
They won't care who was wrong
They would wish you were home

It's like Lee and Molly
Or maybe Leah alone

Hey! She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
She's laughing when there ain't no joke, hey!!!

[Verse 2: Damian ""Jr. Gong"" Marley]
Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar like born to be wild
But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar
A waste of a sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Work the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy
She love limelight more than John Swayze
Seen more miles than a rental, Avis
She don't slow down then some day maybe
She lost then she can't find her way to safety

Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite
Because she got a insatiable appetite
For stayin out late night with all the parasites
Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
Five minutes, she stay on the move
She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself
I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
And now she on the track workin while she wastin away
It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay
Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this..

For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirtin
Now she season me and don't need rehearsin
Esteem get a beatin', life is uncertain
Ego need feedin now no one's mercy
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin
Behind the curtain she's really hurtin
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer that bring and cook the rock down
And she without sinnin will spot the first stone
The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass goin bout there own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'
Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow

And badges screamin' at young black children: ""Stop or I will shoot""

I can remember when huh those slavery times...

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
What you won't and what you will
Working for your dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a youth gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of us think we're too big
'Cause the system gives us jobs
Even though it's just a low paying gig
Some of us will boast and brag
And those of us who think we're small
Just because we don't have much
That's really not the case at all
There's riches that the flesh can't touch
Some of us won't respect names
Some of us won't respect loves
Some of us don't respect life
Even though we worship God
And some of us won't let go faith
No matter what the price may cost
Some of us won't practice hate
Because we still believe in love

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
What you won't and what you will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Neighbors free to shoot at will
Hurt' to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five, we know the drill
Weekends are such a short-lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Most of us think we're too good
Just because material gain
If we were living as we should
Then less of us would be in pain
Those who are misunderstood
Still deserve a voice to claim
The things that are still meaningful
To each and all of us the same
And some will say the cups are full
And give Jah thanks to what we've gained
And some will say there's much more weight to pull
And them will tell you that straight up and plain
And some will think outside the box
While some of us will hold our lanes
And some of us we write the facts
While some of us a chop down cane

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
What men won't and what they will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Hurts to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short-lived thrill
Sad' to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

[Outro]
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Those slavery times... I can remember when huh...",Damian Marley,Slave Mill,

Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
Many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
There’s nothing wrong with having fun
Don’t let the system tame you
It’s just a part of being young
And even though they’re quick to blame you
Picking on you like a plum
Because your dream became true
Now look what they’ve become
In open sight and plain view
They’ve already had a run
So meanwhile they try to change you
It’s not over till it’s done
So please remain the same you

You might not think you know enough
Don’t let that deter you
It’s all apart of growing up
And we’re all young enough to learn to
And don’t you live life in a rush
The past cannot be returned to
And when you feel like giving up
Remember patience is a virtue
When you fall try to get up
Have some guts, I’m trying to urge you
Be proud of owning up
The truth will never hurt you

Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world (hey young world)

Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
'Cause many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
So when you’re rising start, be wise and smart
Try make your mark
Don't you hype and floss, and drive to fast
'Cause life’s too short
Try make good times last 'cause time fly past
And if time is money, that means time cost
But it don’t cost money to joke and laugh
So if you love somebody hurry up and talk

Could you be so kind and show me a sign
I've been searching and it's so hard to find
Decent values with a decent wine

Maybe it's the way that I've been spending my time
I'm still searching for a fine peace of mind
Decent jubee running it down the line

A little child has grown and he's got love on his mind
But what he'll never know a virtuous woman is hard to find
And dat's when she said she feels the pain

So if you is a gal with whole heap of value
What a valuable nice and decent gal you
When I get you I'll be glad I got you

Seen some little silly go and come tings
Seen some one night just for fun tings

I don't pamper neither pet girl, ayo

Baby love me love you bad nobody naffi force me
Sorry baby, didn't mean to dj coastly
Your body boasi'
Your spirit is a blessin', I'm so glad you chose me
So listen closely

Woman yuh lovin' good mi seh it never yet fail
Supmn weh yuh have so fat, it pop down scale
Mi blood start rush me supmn tougher dan nail
One touch an' she blush, me nuh coward and frail
Big up raggamuffin, you a the girl dem sperm whale
Man a rudeboy we nuh run down skirt tail
No deviation to the plan or curtail
Some a seh dem a don, and a living mermale
Tell dem man a gyalis from we inna first grade
We no shoot an' miss any woman we persuade
You star the screenplay, you affi replay
Woman yuh somethin' good me nah fi wear no blue suede
Hell an' powder house, the big ship set sail
Woman a feel we up like when the blind a read braille
Loving is a mission of precision and detail
Steer 'pon track that a nuh train, nuh derail

So when you're ready
My love won't let you down
And if you come my way
I'll be at your service
And so ride with me, until the wheels fall off
So I can be all that you're dreaming of

Quit playing hard to get girl
It's me that you won't forget girl
It's too hard to find the next girl
I don't pamper neither pet girl

Me rough like sandpaper texture
Bend up your face and vex girl
Soon I might find a next girl
But for now you got my attention

So when you're ready
My love won't let you down
And if you come my way
I'll be at your service
And so ride with me, until the wheels fall off
So I can be all that you're dreaming of

So when you're ready
My love won't let you down
And if you come my way
I'll be at your service
And so ride with me, until the wheels fall off
So I can be all that you're dreaming of

Quit playing hard to get girl
It's me that you won't forget girl
It's too hard to find the next girl
I don't pamper neither pet girl",Damian Marley,Upholstery,Major Myjah
"[Intro]
Out in the street, they call it murder

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Jamrock
Camp where the thugs dem camp at
Two pound ah weed inna van back
It inna ya hand bag, ya knapsack
It inna ya backpack
The smell ah give your girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals ah nuh back to
Di thugs dem will do whe dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff ting come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laff an lock  arrf traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down an it ah beat rapid
Police coming inna jeep and dem cyaan stop it
Some say dem ah playboy, ah playboy rabbit
*Funny man ah* get dropped like a bad habit
So nuh bodah pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the street, they call it murder

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Jam down
Poor people ah dead at random
Political violence, cyaan done
Pure ghost and phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the kings of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unuh hand if you with me
To see this sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me,
To win election dem trick we
Then dem don't do no ting at all
C'mon let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most ah de youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem take the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff likkle youth have up some fat 'matic
With di extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And ah bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Glocks, ah dem a lock rocket
They will full you up ah current like ah short circuit
Dem a run ah road back which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin' nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck back ratchet

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock

Searching for the light because you're living in the dark
You must realize that Jah was with you from the start
Glorify his works and please be upfull in your thoughts
Even thought the ones who wish you well are few and far apart
People never thought that we would make it thru so far
Speak of love Jah children and be proud of who you are

If your brother weak then you must help him if you're strong
Love him for the right and do not judge him for the wrong
If your sister lost then you must help her find her way

Love you oneanother for the Father loves us all
Keep on concentrating on the brighter side of life

"[Intro: Damian Marley]
Everybody is having sex these days like sex is going out of style
You know what I'm saying
Nobody is in love any more
You know what I'm saying
Once upon a time, you had to meet both of a girl’s grandmothers before you could get it
You know what I'm saying, now a days it's like you can fall and slip and land in some
(what kinda loosey goose dat)

[Chorus: Eve]
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
And there is a rather large population
Of hole sale suppliers
Dat might as well hand out fliers
Some gyals nowa days give you
Faster than preyers
And there is no love
Mama always told from the age of ten
She can't be my girl
If she can't be my friend
Fi think some gyal love man
Just for money for spend
I'm hurt my love
What about di youths dem
Weh love fi breed off the girls
And still nah care for da youth dem
Wahapn to the boots dem
And hear wah mek go worse
Nuff a dem did have and nah use dem
Fire fi di bait who love using the girls
So friend can congratulate dem
Rasta nah rate dem
When dem abusing di girls
Gun shot for bwoy weh ah rape dem

[Chorus: Eve]
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Some gyal like the hour of talking before dem will mek you shoot it
Meanwhile some gi ya anywhere the car is parking
Some only when secluded
Well some gyal put themselves on the market
Pum pum fit to suited
With di more expensive packages marking
Batteries not included
Some bwoy shoot wild like machine gun cupid
Just cause dap and doop did
And still don't have no one to call there own
Don't you think that's kinda stupid
Some bwoy have dem weak
And that's why dem can't refuse it
And dem think with dem john every day of the week
Well some fool better mind dem loose it

[Chorus: Eve]
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love

[Verse 3: Eve]
Ayo, some take life for granted
Some don't understand it
The way we living is outlandish
Sex, they oughta ban it
Sometimes I think niggas lay down with any type of female
Blame it on the drink
Scream I love you like it ain't an issue to diss you
Wanna make love but he can't kiss you
I wish you cats would understand procreation
Instead of using it for recreation
I mean, it's just my obligation
Plenty of kids running 'round without their daddy
Plenty of hungry mothers tricking, kids be looking shabby
And they only trying to make ends meet
Plenty of struggling mothers scrubbing toilets, scraping up the bottoms of their feet
What we need is more conscious people
Need to teach the world their children need you
And cats be at the people like they never knew their problem's here
And on the real this is a problem that we all share
Come on

[Chorus: Eve]
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love

[Verse 4: Damian Marley]
How some gyal head so light
It must the altitude
How some gyal get so bright
Within their attitude
Why some gyal wanna wuk
Down the multitude
Don't they know their the mothers of
Aahhhhhh
Respect to the ladies
Weh care the youths
And all of the ladies
Weh bare the youths
Single parents wid no one
To contribute
She goin 5 months and over
Aahhhhhh
All of the ladies
Weh face the truth
Even when belly bigger
Than a pumpkin fruit
And still no one there yet
To contribute
She goin 9 months all over
Aahhhhhh
Why some parents
Don't hear di youths
Why some parents
Don't prepare di youths
And why some parents
Must fear the youths
From all ten years and over
Aahhhhhh

[Chorus: Eve]
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love",Damian Marley,Where Is the Love,Eve
