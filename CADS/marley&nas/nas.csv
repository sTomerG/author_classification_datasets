""When I flow for the street.."" - "".. who else could it be""
""Nas..""

[Verse 1]
Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin'
Livin carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]
""When I flow for the street.."" - "".. who else could it be""

""Make everything right.."" - ""Get yours...""

[Verse 2]
Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]

[Verse 3]
Baby girl she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late
Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin' Ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood

[Verse 1: Nas]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, 'cause of a

[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Bridge: Nas]
Accident murderer
Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary

[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of em, read the bulletin

"[Verse 1: Nas]
The ghetto Othello, the Moor
Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 2: Nas]
The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 3: Nas]
What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy

Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree",Nas,Adam and Eve,The-Dream

Fuck outta here, second guessin' our love
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cookbook, you gossipin', watchin' hip-hop & love, uh

[Verse 1: Nas]
I don't mean to be brass, even a genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends, they don't mess with rappers, correction
I'm Akhenaten, King Tut's predecessor
I fantasize, and no mind him, I'm slick with words
Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor
Brother, homie, love, a friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, fuck that low shit
I'm on some more 'everybody-should-know' shit
Or let's be real discreet
Everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate (Ayy)
When was the last time her and a man was straight? (Ayy)
Just chill, light bulbs dim (Ayy)

The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
You start to get comfortable after you get it right
Yeah, you start to get comfortable after you get it right

[Verse 2: Nas]
Misogynistic monologue what we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest, and higher North
But below the waist, I'm a dog
Your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name with a diamond cross
But you a strong, stand-tall soldier
They lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me
Feel your good vibes layin' on me
When them light bulbs dim
Lemme watch you, my adult film

[Intro: AZ]
This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moët Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it times three, we got 48
Which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

"[Intro: Nas & (Flo Simpson)]
Yo, it's like waking up, from a bad dream (America)
Just to figure out, you wasn't dreaming in the first place (no)

[Verse 1: Nas]
If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Claim to, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona's that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up, a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up
A dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves

[Chorus: Nas, (Flo Simpson) & Both]
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
This is not what you think it is

Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive, Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas

[Chorus: Nas, (Flo Simpson) & Both]
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
This is not what you think it is
America (America, Americaaaaaa
This is not what you think it is)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit on the Senate, and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the Bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron like, ""Bring me my dinner dear""
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far are we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be

This is not what you think it is)

This is not what you think it is)

[Vers 1: Nas]
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh

Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends
Probably businessmen, I sense good taste
And they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm tryna keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

[Hook: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

[Verse 3: Kelis]
I don't care about the runaways, I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS, but I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think we're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)

[Kelis]
Can we make a change, you know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way

I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle

[Verse 2: Nas]
A message to those who trapped us up
From federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough
Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
Look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
Even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies
Pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers
Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon'
Just stand and watch you die
I'mma pass you a .9, I'mma grab your hand
Come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king
Who murdered the Christ, the same regime
What God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate
Man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from

First I see a flashin' light, then on my own
I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone
I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell
Is it now that I'm to be judged?
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like I'm movin' through high winds
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near

[Hook: Nas]
You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for I am that I am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb

[Nas]
Seen my body layin' down in the ground
It was painless, didn't feel a thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
I was atheist, committed Suicide
I wish I could erase this shit
I seen a new life before the Christ
He created night & day, the sun & moon
From the virgin woman's womb
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace & fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin'

[Hook]

[Nas]
Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I
Face to face (uh) fightin' my case so we debate (where?)
Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then
Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and)
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God)
Send me on a trip God please the Earth
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'
He gave me life, I screamed out loud that ""I Am...""

[Outro: Nas]
And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven (I Am)
Clothe wit the cloud (Nastradamus)
And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown (I Am)
And his face was lit as were the Sun (I Am)
And his feet as pillars of fire (Nastradamus)
And his name was Nastradamus (I Am)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

[Verse 2]
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

[Verse 3]
""Any other real niggas in the world besides us?"" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

[Verse 4]
Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling",Nas,A Queens Story,
"[Intro]
You are who you associate with
Look around at your five closest friends
And that's who you are
If you don't want to be that person
You know what you gotta do

[Chorus: Nas]
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

[Verse 1: Nas]
You can try to kill me, but I come back
Hate me, that's a small thing
Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring
Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor
Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war
With my body, gravity got me
Police want me arrested, just to see me naked
Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip
Thugs shooting reckless (every night, niggas)
Wonder, how will I exit (from this life, niggas?)
Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river
You should watch them people with you
Let them street rules hit you
If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that
'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that
There's slugs for that
Oh, you didn't know your man was talking?
That's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin
When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought
Every time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk
Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas
So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas
I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique
Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick

[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]

That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot
They can shake your hand, girl, then they take your man, girl
The whole hood knowing, we got something good going
None of these hoes is after me
'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me
Now they wishing that they had me
So watch who you hang with, and who you cling with
You know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips
(With a baller) after she done gave him some head
(He never called her) he gang it and he left her for dead
Birds of a feather fly together
But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die
And you affiliated, now you look weak
'Cause your peeps is freaks
Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets
And they brought your down in the dirt
You was a pretty, young, smart thing
Going to work, I bet it hurt, 'cause you had a clean rep
But the girls you seen with make these niggas say
""I bet that bitch suck a mean dick"", word

[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]

That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas

Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman

[Verse 3: Stic.man]
A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne
Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own
I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth
Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss
Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down
Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown
And some only come around when everything is green
Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team
For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus
If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?
There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly
Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy
Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant
My politics boss up, for you black empowerment
I stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent
Only associate with those for my betterment
I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines
Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind
Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through
And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you
Don't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly
If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye
You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew
I'm like Scarface: Who I trust? Me, that's who

[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]

That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas

A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners

To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw

"[Intro: Nas]
Peace y'all, yeah
This one right here goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal, loyal ones
You for me and me for you
We see things alike
We live alike, in truth

[Verse 1: Nas]
The craziest things already happened, get me
Could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame? yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
Tell you lames something, spit some game
Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?
When you place blame, then you're defective
When you take blame, then you're respected
You gotta give me credit

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Woah
Life is good, I must admit it
Woah
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah
Life is good, it's good, it's good

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh
The craziest things just happened to me, get me
So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

[Chorus: RaVaughn, Nas]
Woah
Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah)
Woah (Beautiful life)
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah (Life's still good)
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah (Yeah, yeah)
Life is good, it's good, it's good

[Verse 3: Nas]
A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
Akinyele, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

[Outro: Nas]
Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world

"[Intro:]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

[Hook: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2:]
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said ""At least that nigga ain't ugly!""
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...",Nas,Beginning and End,The Game
"[Chorus]
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

[Verse 1]
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now

(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around

She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

[Verse 2]
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours

[Chorus]
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her

"[Verse 1]
Get yours nigga
'Cause I'ma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things

[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners
I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 2]
When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things (ill)
Gotta get my life together man (uh huh)
'Cause now I'm into big things (big things)
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more)
'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all)
You know I can't do that shit no more (why?)
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?)
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)
I'm into big things (uh)
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 3]
I go past y'all (UH-HUH)
Y'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH)
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH)
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God

Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things

"What, what...yeah

[Verse 1: Nas]
I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime
Since the blackout in Queensbridge in '79
Everybody's a killer now; pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window wherever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens kings, I used to view the cats that are old
Seeing things that made me real from my skin to my soul
Girls who turned hoes, friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring death wherever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know
It's all real though

[Interlude]
Everything is real
Where we Headed now?
Up to more money, would be more fun
Leave with mo' bitches, carry more guns
Where we headed now? Where we going, yo?
It's getting real, son; we gon' let it flow
Where we Mo' bitches, it be more dough
It be more fun, holding more...

[Verse 2: Nas]
How the hell are we supposed to excel from the street
Where the Jake's crew face young kids who wanna eat?
Quantum Leap to this Black world, hustlers and ghettos
Self-made millionaires who tussle with the devil
Bust a lil metal lead, wrestle you, to the pebbles
On the hard ground, that's if your guard down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the horn with the god Shapelle, my Queens comrade
Yo, run and come in with the dime bag

[Verse 3: Shapelle]
Ayo, I need dat, I got to smoke dat
Send me some Chunky Black, so I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain, but the thought still remain
Yo, it's on again once the death stunts these chains
'Cause I been through it; the drug game, I thought I knew it
I got knocked, took it to trial, but I blew it
25, but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me; got me wrapped up like a mummy
Now I'm in the system a.k.a. the devil's home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with, drug dealers, and chain stealers
Bitch niggas who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine, sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots, but I civilized the savage
I sat him down and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...
About this reefer I'ma get this weekend
On the V.I., I rather be... uh, damn, damn",Nas,Black Folks,

I'm trying to get up OUTTA here

Not that White Star!

[JoJo Hailey]
Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby baby listen

[Verse 1: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - following week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up ma, fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

[Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 2: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Like Isis, you got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen
To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree

[Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 3: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

[Outro: JoJo Hailey]
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
Black girl lost",Nas,Black Girl Lost,JoJo Hailey

They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

We ain't ready, to have a black president"")

[Verse 1: Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh

What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: ""How can I protect my life?
Protect my wife? Protect my rights?""
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: ""What the fuck?!"", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?

Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again

I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Nas)]
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)]
I'm back in the hood, they like, ""Hey Nas"" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, ""Why""? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word

I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)

"[Verse 1]
Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fucked behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Verse 3]
You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years

Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossin' with Stoute, he had the 'gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin' her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hittin' it raw, tastin' it, wildin' out of my character
Tapin' it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips
Givin' head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husband's affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sportif
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin'
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adaptin'
P-11's, ACP shells for blastin'
Caught him with his Spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burnin' her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence
His maid cried ""No"", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought ""What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision""
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet a-gain...

Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screamin', yo we almost crashed
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death",Nas,Blaze a 50,
"[Intro]
Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'mma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah

[Verse 1]
The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swings

[Hook]
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ash tray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

[Verse 2]
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave like, ""This is how you repay me?!""
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said ""No mountain's high enough,"" fly stuff
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell
Gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange

[Hook]

[Outro]
I could smell old bogey cigars
Long record perfumes, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top
Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby – know what I mean?
Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in ""Gone with the Wind""
And she didn't get allowed
Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint
Man, you know they were strong back then, man
Blunt from my ash tray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah",Nas,Blunt Ashes,

So many niggas get fucked up in the game
See, that's where they get caught out there in that word ""Game""
'Cause it's not no fuckin' game

[Verse 1]
When you hear shells coming at ya
Hot ones from a shotgun, I bet nigga runs faster
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster
Think about that casket—you don't wanna be in that shit
Quick to take consignment; you taking everybody's package
Money over bitches was the law you practiced
So you act as if money was no object
Spendin' fazools, trips for your whole projects
Epcot Center, linens for ya bitches, Rolies for your dogs
Now we in the mall, slayed by his bitches
Every day I'm reminiscing, how he was living, having fun
'Cause any day coulda led to prison
Not for a short bid, 'cause if the feds ever caught kid
It'd be like 25 years conspiracy
Another 25 for RICO, snatching up him and his people
He had his jeep bulletproof, silencers on the Desert Eagle
Flipping bricks in Gary, Indiana
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer
Only trusted two things: his trigger and his hammer
Used to be a bum 'til he had a six-month run
Had a lawsuit, 30 G's, the case was won
Met with Mexican Hoyé, cop boya
Bought a barbershop, named it after seeing Sade
That's where they found his body, in a barber chair face down
Bullets in his chest, sliced apart from the waist down
Planned to sell his shop, stick Hoyé for everything he got
Take jewels and his pies
Fill his shoes with cement and drop his body in the tides
But Hoyé was wise
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive

[Chorus]
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive

[Verse 2]
Cokehead Sandra, she grew in Gowanus
Her man was large and Sandra was his baby mama
Stayed in drama, fighting with hood rats that he was fucking
No job all day, she did nothing
They son was 7-years-old, she really was a wifey
First should she would transport blow, overnight for a G
He paid up front, they laid up once
She got pregnant, she wouldn't dead it
She had a boy, named her son Infinite after his father who did dirt
She didn't know disaster would follow
Capsules and bottles of crack in the back of his Mazda
He let her drive while he drove the burgundy 5
He often talk about how he wants to murder these guys
From off of Bergen Street, had mad work in the street
Lifestyle, richest nigga, far from how he used to be
Never thought he'd rock diamonds; never took weakness for kindness
That's how he gradually grew
Did a favor for a favor—now the nigga in with the crew
And now he live major, house in Dix Hills next to Brooke Shields
With the cook and the maid, shit was real
Saved his first bills made in his bodega
""Good luck, player"" sign on the paper taped in the window
Escaped from a would-be kidnap, and slept
Thought niggas feared his rep 'til he got wet
Woulda had the world in his hands, his girl did a scam
The owner's rich, is boning niggas to get rid of her man
Welcome to the game, baby

[Chorus]
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
The hardest thing to do is stay alive
The hardest thing to do is stay alive",Nas,Body In A Box,

Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it

[Verse 1]
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue,"" it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

[Break]
Oh shit, Tina!
I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme is weak
This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here
(My book of rhymes)
Gandhi was a… what the fuck?

[Verse 2]
Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote this… nah, it's weak)
The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares
(Nah, that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real
I can't fight you, ‘cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
This can't be my book of rhymes

This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!

Nah, neva that! Fuck that!
Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist?
Hah, you a funny nigga...
Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes)
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?!

[Verse 3]
Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood
Our values so low, our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we should've heeded
‘Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t—
I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)",Nas,Book of Rhymes,

I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim
Chronic leaf hitting, all kinds of heat with him, wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
'Til I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'ma guap, then I cop
Then I yacht, then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers, who shoot up any club
To see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or they coked up
Suggesting I post a, bail, I'm like, ""Yes"" 'cause we soldiers
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder

I'm, fresh out of city housing, ain't have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty Henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothing less than a 740
With fresh linen, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with Airborne

I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's go!...
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

[Verse 2: Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

I was born in Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Moved to New York City, where I had my first child

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 2: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 3: Nas]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop

When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme

This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you

Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love

That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25

[Chorus]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Hook]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Nas,Can’t Forget About You,
"[Intro]
Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it

[Verse 1]
Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues
And Slyvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables

[Hook]
When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition

[Verse 2]
Some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em. I promise I carry on tradition

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?

And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

[Verse 1]
I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home

[Verse 2]
I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle’s perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'? I be tryin' to reply and
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I’d gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of ""Me & My Bitch"" by Biggie
With all respect 'cause you the only one that gets me

[Intro]
And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
To read his latest poem for us

[Scratching by DJ Premier]
""Ladies and gentlemen..""
""Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus""
""Everybody watch him""
""Ladies and gentlemen..""
""Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus""
""We-we-we came a long way""
""Ladies and gentlemen..""
""Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus""
""Everybody watch him""
""Ladies and gentlemen..""
""Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus""*

[Verse 1]
Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names, living off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing

[Scratching by DJ Premier]
""Ladies and gentlemen..""
""Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus""
""Everybody watch him""}

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Verse 2]
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Verse 3]
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
- and dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice
Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from Hooters, cops pursue you hard
Run your place, put guns in your face
Put you in the car for nothing (Green Lantern!)
Now you struggling, tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charge you for murder
Why? ‘Cause these liars
Say you shot another man in his driveway
Guilty, just for being Black on a Friday
Polygraph test, you’re failing, because you’re nervous
Charged with murder you didn’t commit, then they serve ya
Fifteen years, maximum security
Slashing, stab wounds, broken bone, injuries
You were placed there intentionally
Either you bang or you miss me
Listen to me, this is true!

Newton, for shooting and killing a pig in Oakland
“Free Huey, the sky’s the limit!” became the slogan
Jail bars open, then Huey told ‘em:
“Let my brothers free with me and slam the jail bars closed then”
I go then to say today, “Where are those men?”
Slaughtered by COINTELPRO and coke, and
Heroin, this era we in, we think we chilling
In our Harry Winston, in our high-priced clothing
Some of these P.D.s is tired of us
They got they orders from they higher-ups to line us up
From age and up, then they fire on us
The inconvenient truth got them lying to us

The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
""Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!""
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, ""Ree, put your hands up, black boy!""

I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die

If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high

I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have—

[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have—

One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have

[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

[Verse 3]
And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

"[Verse 1]
Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamour, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holdin’ weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Gettin' props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable
Gun salute life rapidly, that's the ritual

Blunts, thugs and alcohol, what a mixture
Just picture, ya life as a whole judged in court they convict ya
They telling you your state of mind, like you worthless
So he curses, his mom saying Bible verses
That's all she works with
But miracles never leave the churches
Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase
A house, with a swimming pool, labels me a sinning fool
I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel
To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to
Respect this and all respect due is the essential
To street life, hustlin’, the struggle, broke ghettos
Boiling coke settles slow inside a glass kettle
Darren Levy on my TV, lifestyles of living easy
Got my crew tense, plottin’ to jips, to get whips with BBs
Pushing cakes, knew anorexics with ten plates
Celebrating elevation in the seeds that we make
So How You Like That?

Gators for pretty boy haters
In Vegas with chicks trickin’ fortunes

Still I'm drifting in a high, blunts is like insulin

Stash box zone in my trunk, I flash not, teeth golden
Look at me now, Ma
Blowin’ but for how far?
Cars, cash, and bitches got me out more
And things you never dreamed I can vouch for
Snake niggas slither on the A-alikes
I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike
Never the one to ask for the time to a saint
A mask and nine, I think, will make my problems sink
Down a canal, similar to how we drink
Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links
Drug money, snortin’ bitches, in the end of times
Got my nine, 'til I flatline, nigga, give me mine

Déjà vu....",Nas,Déjà vu,
"[Intro]
This is a journey into the world's most largest and notorious projects: Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

[Verse 1]
He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex, his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
(But it's so hard) to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Verse 2]
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy (far.. far away)
(Backward ass niggas, man fuck them niggas
Go head with the program man proceed)
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Verse 3]
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you, a cheque's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown: ""How that sound?"" Poor thing!
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Outro]
""The Bridge is over,"" my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'!
Braveheart to the graveyard! I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or don't even rep this, man!
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man!
Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man?
Niggas be buckin'!
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man! Stay out the magazines!
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin':
That means the cowards get out, and real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side:
Hating me cause I'm beautiful!
Real niggas in Queensbridge:
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby!

Pyramid architects, Perignon bottles
Money, jewelry want me then come get me
Hit me but don't miss me, you history
Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee, Italian dons from Sicily kiss me
This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty
Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me
Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo
Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though
My big bro told me plain and simple, ""Nas do not look back""

Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs

[Verse 1]
Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row
Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros
Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes
So where them years go?
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so

[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 2]
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin', ""Join the armed forces!""
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago
Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle

[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 3]
Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin'
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got ""God's Son"" on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected
From Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws
And it's like that

The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs

"[Verse]
Hell yeah
Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin'
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin'
Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin'
Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex
I break it down, how to adress, the opposite sex
Problems or questions, I can answer them best

Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christión
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef

Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities and hood movie stars
Gat slingers, now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar

[Verse 1]
The path we all walk starts out long, it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancin' with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five, realizin' the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, Dijon-scented with Al Green on
My theme song, Love & Happiness, how can it seem wrong?
I mean, before this, I used to rock a Taurus with the donuts
Now, I grown up, I got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho 'nuff
Niggas actin' cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz off the Dutch
This is everyday, every second gotta make it pay
Every lesson I learnt got me open
While most of these rappers'll stay burnt

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobarro
El Derado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems and shot pockets
My niggas on the block rock this, box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in triple ways
Goin' through this difficult stage called life
But each year, my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity
Amply, livin' in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, livin' this king's life
Magazines write about me in this dream, it's all tight

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now, the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Ice, the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that, but I'm continuin' to make more stacks
Halftime, New York State of Mind, It Was Written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane, wake up when we land, feelin' real scared
On the ground, Rollie flush, princess cuts and large rounds
The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions

Now I just go up, they know when I got it tucked
Tip the door man, racist neighbors flinching
They don't know if I'ma rob 'em or if I'm Russell Simmons
They thought it was me, just like Mike Bivins
They pray for my downfall like the mom of Robin Givens
Watching how you living
I just wanted to roll B-L-U-N-T, and watch B-E-T
Picture Amerie eating Free
I'm trying to write hood movies, like Posse and Five Heartbeats
I'm all inside a dark room
My incense smoke took the form of ghost and it spoke
It said, ""Nas, you the best on both coasts, you so big
You should write the word slave
On both sides of ya beards like Prince did
So what's this? Fuck St. Nicholas

Everybody wanna be king but can't handle the pain
Used to rap now they all wanna sing
Ask Elizabeth Taylor, when did ice turn to bling
She said, ""Nas, it 'cause y'all rock tiny diamonds in the biggest chains
You the first nigga in the game that said fuck fame
You the 5th nigga in The Beatles
You the 10th nigga in the Wu-Tang, so nigga let yo' nuts hang""
But they can't handle it, I'm scandalous, I'm trifling
That's why I'm wifing 'em, quick to stick a knife in 'em
Catch me thinking, drinking, hurting my health

Staring at the face of my watch
It's like a crystal ball with the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck 'cause I know where the missile fall
'Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich and small
Went to my man crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up his voice whispered, ""nigga ball""
So I smoke the finest, 85 footer ocean liners
I do it for the have nots of mad spots
That resemble screensavers on your laptops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I'll be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue Fila velour suits

Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Interlude 1]
Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

[Interlude 2]
I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!",Nas,Ether,
"[Verse 1]
Peace, peace
Yo, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game God
D&G glasses, cloth Kangols, guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking, fresh to my ankles, thankful
Gangster see gangster do, I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war

[Chorus]
Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

[Verse 2]
Peace, fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em, fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
'Cause now instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far, your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you 'posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

[Chorus]
Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

[Verse 3]
Peace, I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War cost money and man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise
So we play a mental game, intimidation
Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe
I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

[Chorus]
Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop

"[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

[Chorus: Blitz]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning

[Verse 2: Blitz]
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker

[Chorus: Blitz]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning",Nas,Every Ghetto,Blitz

Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all?
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else

When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, ""Screw that bus!"" – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Vaccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

You'll live, and you'll learn

A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death
Energy could neva be destroyed
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me
With bullets to my head
This is my you can't kill me niggas
I'm already dead, BRING IT!!
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You're on top -- WHAT?
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated

You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours

Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, ""Freeze black kids!""
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door

I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this

Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight

Danger, danger

It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci
Now dey a motherfuckin' see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee
Game over, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here

[Verse 2: Nas]
Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shootin' niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

[Chorus: Nas]
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Verse 3: Scarface]
You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin' cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfuckin' plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind
Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin' mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor

[Chorus: Nas]
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose

That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw

Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

"[Intro]
Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen

[Chorus]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, ""If I am born, will I be safe at all?""
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said ""Stay calm,"" holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, ""At least that nigga ain't ugly""
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers

For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..

[Verse 1]
From ""Breaking Atoms"" to ""Illmatic"", to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate

[Hook]
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

[Verse 2]
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, ""I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?""

To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
In they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro

Mmm, fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats, all the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed then plop, when we done, I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest-
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his tomato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me, you and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside, nothing I need more than a fish fry

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shit, it taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out the tanning salon
When I pull you out the oven from baking, I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty ham hock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder
Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance, still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you 'til there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best
And specialize in cooking swine as a chef, you gon' be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine's mixed with rat, cat and dog combined?
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?

My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it

[Verse 2]
Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this

Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies

Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?

But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me

That's the main reason why God, love us the most

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh

What you say? Can't hear you, man, speak the fuck up
(It's what they want) Word (It's what they want)

[Verse 1]
Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a Mac-10 over a Tec
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""Nigga, light that""
Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?'
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we could cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gon' truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

[Hook]
(It's what they want) Fuck it, you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh? It's what they want)
Fuck it, you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh?) Fuck it, you gotta love it

[Verse 2]
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your clique roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in Suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13-year-old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay Macarena-ing
Marinating, while you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it

[Hook]
Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?)
Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want)
Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?)

Woke up this mornin' (yeah)
You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

[Intro]
(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Ayo it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me, ""Nas ain't all that""
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime

[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out

[Outro]
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime

Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now

Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)

Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

[Verse 1: Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, ""Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!""
Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not so bold but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you

Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop building?
I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways
Makin' fake gold caps
With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks
Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth

You trapped in your own hell
Every day I wake up I'm blessed
Every day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas runnin' around
Talkin' about, ""I'm fucked up,"" ""I got to get on,"" ""I got to…""
""I'm in the grind,"" ""I'm fucked up""
Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up
Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material
I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart

To my moms, look at me, baby

Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So ""Untitled"" it is

With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit

I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Filas
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know, when will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me

Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies

Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak
'Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billie Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

[Chorus: Claudette Ortiz & Kelis]
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

[Outro: Claudette Ortiz]
I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby
I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby",Nas,Hey Nas,"Kelis, Claudette Ortiz (City High)"
"[Verse 1]
Patient
My faith is highly favored by the father, love to all
Rest in peace to Zanu, the barber brought cases
Celebrate and take us back to thought
The real New York, death to rapists and rats
The touch school to Brooklyn stories
The kings, the lifers, the lords of Queens
Or the stories on Puerto Rican righteous, I heard things
Know some people who know people
Getting money, the broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who live where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke with or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect
Where I'm from, it's never over if somebody dies
Somebody gon' ride, years later, somebody son, double 4-5
You laid up in ICU, hoping you survive
Too many stories like this one

What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah
Some are caricatures, amateur boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of sores
Bandages on my finger, still managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind, but I still hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze, dripping
In fear of God, scented in Diptyque fragrance
Some nights Creed flavors, I am motivation
I don't talk on the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, ""No matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson""
Project apartment parties, rest in peace to Marley
Try not to get booked by Officer Laverty

Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed

One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street""to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts

And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut",Nas,Hip Hop Is Dead,​will.i.am

Salivating at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence

Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in

Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Most shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick ‘cause the art of repercussion
Yeah, I seen it, a G going out indecent (when the block is hot)
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his 40s

Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off

Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggas' bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop

Your man'll fry you plus everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin

Hip Hop
It will never die
Hip Hop
It will never, never die

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ghetto nigga strutting, with nothing but dreams in Queens broke
Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke
Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember, we used to be close
Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish someone would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever

Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from the inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water

Dre, he a Compton-Compton OG
Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history

[Verse 1: Nas]
Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together, like, every several years
To sprinkle a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax, sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, no G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? ‘Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe, like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens
The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'

(West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gunshots)

[Verse 2: Game]
1995, eleven years from today
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie
Wanna cop both but only got a 20 on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the 20 on a dub sack
Ripped the package off Illmatic and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm
Bangin' The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm making 'em burn
Ended my peers' careers
Hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, ‘cause I'm ""Ether"" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
If I ruled the world I summons all you weak rap niggas to death

[Bridge: Nas + (Game)]
He a Compton-Compton OG

Yo, the Jordans sportin', come off the dice game
With a fortune walkin', you a walking coffin'
The musket, I tucked it, you bluff it, I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that Soul Plane movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clappin'
Nasty man, from bagging grams and runnin' from cops
To a mil on the hand, a mil on the watch, I'm fuckin' with Doc

If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be) (Now, go)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my Queen""

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be, paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me and bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered they pull me out
I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves
Under beds so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty, it's clear
He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said it was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

Yo, Nas whattup?
Whattup kid?
What going on Ill
I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm coming from
You know what I'm saying
Alright, kick it

[Verse 1]
I'm the nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson I'll have niggas undressing
I'm rolling with a mob and running from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict, if niggas want static
They had it, 'cause I flip just like an acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rolling up Sess
When I dress it's never nothing less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
I got it going on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Stripping mad hoes and kick em to the side
See I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props, tell your pops call the cops
See now I'm on the run, but still having fun
Living by the MAC, my gear is all black
I keep killing because I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm a villain

[Hook]
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

[Verse 2]
I got beef with the President and still loving it
Trying to make plans to overthrow the government
It won't work cause niggas don't believe enough
They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff
Around they wrist, you don't like the sound of this
Rebel, but my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me but you'll never catch us all
While you fucking with the dealers we'll be sticking up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pulling out my banger, stabbing up a stranger
I hear Walkie Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walking with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Staring at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aiming at your temple so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killing, I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I keep bullets racing out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag them
An outlaw, although I never wear a holster
In every town you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop from seeing mad niggas drop
To the concrete, I got police putting chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill and what I can't do my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught I'll do lesser time
Sometimes you gotta plan shit and understand it
See I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is running it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, ""duck down""
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stopping the bank
It's ill how I got the pen dropping the ink
No one can stop this apocalypse
On your record player a method layer so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high post and then lay low
Parlé slow and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killing 'cause I'm a villain",Nas,I’m a Villain,
"[Intro]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching my mom's stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, that my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Looking out my belly button window, my father sighs
On his face he wears a frown, and I'm wondering
If they even want me around, as I go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down the chute again
In the near future when
Mom and pops could agree on this, was here before
But my mom saw her gynecologist, he dumped me off
First they want me, then turn around and say they don't
You got 120 days, do what y'all want
But as for me, coming back, this be the last time
Abort me, keep me or give me away, make up your minds

[Hook 4X: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
They must wanna keep me, 'cause 4 months passed, I'm still alive
Guess I got what they call Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when mom's laying down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food, flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my mom's voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born, will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get out, and grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, '73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms ""Push, and take deep breaths, too""
""Stay calm,"" holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screamed out
Tears pouring down my pop's face, he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said ""At least that nigga ain't ugly!""
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And, yo, I plan to over throw the devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...",Nas,I Shot My Way Out,

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell",Nas,It Ain’t Hard to Tell,
"[Verse 1]
Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles that make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends

Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

Stop waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
""What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out""
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'

Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?

And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor

Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here

Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by

Had the chicken pox
On that toy horse that rocks

That was in the 80's
And now im 17

But now it's slash cocaine
Blast niggas in vaine
Satch yo' chain

Wasn't fun all the honey's say I'm it

That I caught
I was a nasty little nigga I learned to hump before I walk
Kept a sling shot on my side to shoot
Squirrles and cats
Wanted to be Captain America with the
Shield and the hat I started getting older fell
More in love with the streets
Infactuated by the ropes and the shiny
Gold teeth I was to big to break dance
Fuck spiining on my back
My role models now run numbers and sell
Crack this project child blessed

Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G

I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 1]
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together

[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 2]
I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm with you and I won't even care, word

[Verse 3]
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talking this divorcing shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through (uhh)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought Kick in the Door was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' new rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin', I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon
My niggas, but dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover, wait
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with ""Ain't No Niggas""
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit than wantin' to be this King of New York shit
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu (uhh)
Look at the life that I've been through (yeah)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 2]
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learned, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad, baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D, S-O-N – they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo...
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official",Nas,Last Real Nigga Alive,

Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin'
Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

And in the other corner
The lyrical champion
Hailing from Queensbridge, New York
Is the one and only
Nas

And now, ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans joining us around the world.  IT'S SHOWTIME!

Verse 1:
Spirit of the streets
Walks in the ring
From Brownsville to spar fit
To boxing king
Man or machine, an animal
Physical strength and intelligence
But that type of intellect
Y'all respect
To connect those punches
Still as a kid he stole lunches
To mak'in millions and the hundreds
Chaotic conscience
The rage, the stage, the grander
Had to endorse slander
Took it like a man
Cause the mighty stand alone
In the bigger ring hole
The penitentiary
Barbed wire and stone was amp up
They locked a champ up
Even my brains in handcuff
The robin hood, seasonal santa
And y'all give him nothin to begin with
Dilapidated buildings
The drug epidemics
Historical stories
Pain, love and glory
Mike Tyson
Never see another like him

? voice over: Speed
Nas: strength
? : skill
Nas: Power

Nas: Legacy
? : Victorious
Nas: Legendary

Verse 2:
True legend
His hands was two weapons
Understand this minds a true blessing
Designer jewels and diamond
A modern day Jack Johnson
Flying private jets and fully protect'in
Automized with ladies Godiva complexions
Lots of sex'in
Hung with a lot of stars
Learned a lot of lessons
Between dead homies and best friends
And getting domed out in stretch Benz
Educated from the hood and pestilence
The dead presidents don't see your pockets
You just gett'in
You got a full court press for them
Benjamins, I've seen money be the death of men

It's a warriors world
Only the strong survive
Who's next to try
Who's next to be the next
T-Y-S-O-N
He gave us hope
May the best man win

Mr. International, the man centerfold, women loathe
Voice bump out the Bose in a tinted Rolls
Craftiness, take a stab at it
Don't ask if Nasty's back at it
I don't run out of magic
Popular, box-cutter flow
Time is money; the watch cost dough
Shakin' the dice, fragrances from some beautiful ladies
The lights, the ambiance, yeah, this is the life
The money, hotties on each arm - It's on
I party like a rap star, baby, the facts are
The third time's a charm
So, meet me by the Eiffel Tower
Bring a bottle of Dom

[Cee-Lo]
I am here (I am here)
This is the place (This is the place)
The atmosphere of espionage at expensive taste
And each one that I see is an unfamiliar face
So, I guess I'll just cut straight to the chase
And before I could say the name of who've I came to see
Someone suspicion then came to me
I'm so close and I've come so far
A glass of red wine sent from the woman at the end of the bar
I love to talk to you; but I don't have the time
She looks like the prettiest part of a perfect crime
Ohh, if I could I could I'd put a picket fence around a wild flower
But darling I have Less Than an Hour
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Hmmmm... Ohhhh... funny how time flies when you're having fun
(Nas: Yeah, let' em know) But I got to do what must be done

[Verse 2]
You're on a winnin' streak
You've survived the killer streets
Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet
Number seven might get you to Heaven
You break the bank, just might make you a legend
It's after eleven, you playin' against a poker face
Genie eyes, light green, sippin' on Bellini's
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch
She'll be a devil in disguise; lady incubus
Better know who to trust
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs
I'mma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em
The crews do somethin' new, inform me

(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Ohhh... time will wait baby

It's clear out there, yeah
It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic ‘cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 2]
This ain't to glorify, just painting a street picture
There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers
Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff, and
It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin' and flaggin'
Got the West Coast laughin'
Now Esco's askin', ""What happened?""

Bullets and baguettes, Benz Bose Speaker Terror
Deman I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red
Like that horse standing on it's hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder
Not Ned the Wino like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart, ‘cause y'all will run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about Ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake getter, the ex-wig splitter to touch you, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game
We can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas

You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing

See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

Fuck the misery, you living po' we gettin dough
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best

No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga

Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

To my niggas.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh)
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(But yo..) this life is the only life I know...

[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, ""Please daddy pay it""
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...

[Verse 2]
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it

Why don't you turning them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig?
Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness

Tell me which one are you, you

[Verse 1: Nas]
The good man in me say, ""Get money and stay on the path""
But the pimp shit in me say, ""Yo, keep looking for ass""
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Revenge to get, against - who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored
Single breasted, a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga...

Ay pimping been going on man for eons and eons man since the beginning of time
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind, and get mine
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know
Do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9"", so fine, she could for sure grind
She was sleek, chic, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said ""Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga""

"[Intro:]
Uhh, Uhh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill

[Verse 1]
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, Tequila bottle in
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, Can´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tied they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin him too
JFK on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate

[Verse 2: Havoc (Prodigy)]
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me
We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser
Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped
(Floatin' in the river with your body wrapped in plastic)
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in
Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin'
We think smarter, reach harder
Got the .44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on the phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock or swerve on it

We like a smooth fam', but rougher than El DeBarge's
Catchin' charges, of marksmen, livin' heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit

Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it

A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character

Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces

Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled

Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

[Outro]
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness",Nas,Made You Look,
"[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, laced at Macy's, don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces, cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction
Or my Tom Ford collection? Gangstas two-stepping
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all livin' trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we riding heavy, NY to Miami cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
We make the world go round
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Verse 2: The Game & Chris Brown]
I see the haters on the floor jocking my swag
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags and pouring champagne inside a Polo glass
Model bitches rolling grass, Escobar unfolding cash
Toasting with my entourage, went from robbing armored cars
To all my stars, red carpet to the L'Ermitage
We throwing red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We The Best!) Big pimping, top down chrome spinning
""Top Gun"", Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen
No [censored], just Romo
You tryna shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson, that's so-so
Nick want his (baby back), but that's Loso
Tell Hawaii Five-O to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my Polo
CB, let 'em know though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
We make the world go round
From my town to your town
We on top, no stopping us now
We got Patron, the ballers two stepping
Ladies on the floor and all 'em two stepping
From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping
(From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping)
So iced out, it's easy to point them haters out

[Verse 3: Nas]
We start with Bellini's and end with Patrón shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shopping
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer peach Schnaps, Perrier-Jouët, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seeing me's like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light flashing
And I'm laughing, my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track
What!

[Chorus: Nas & Chris Brown]
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round

Lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse 1]
Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
'Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my masterminds

It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, ""drive home""
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said ""Goodbye""
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon' be
But I'm a mastermind

I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury

That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too

Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'?
We gonna do a lil somethin' like this

Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

[Verse 1]
I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler
I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace God!) Peace God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all…

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: Is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

[Verse 1]
The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Ohhh money you my honey

Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob

Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron

Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit

Rule 2: thought you knew don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait

From non-blastin' to auto, I don't have to blast mine
They blast mine, black 9, you flatline, my cash climb

Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner

Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot 'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max

It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares

I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

[Chorus: Nas]
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)

[Outro: Nas]
This goes out to Che Guevara;
A Revolutionary destroyed by his country
Just trying to fight for what's real
This goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
Just trying to fight for what's real
This goes out to Martin, all about peace and destroyed by his own country
This goes out to everybody in the whole world
Just trying to fight for what's real
To Patrice Lumumba;
Just trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people
This goes out to my hood niggas
Coming up everyday just trying to survive the only way we know how
But see we know too much now, and we seen too much now
So ain't nothing gon' to stop us now
To my country, to my country, my country, my country...",Nas,My Country,Nashawn
"[Verse 1]
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

[Chorus 1]
(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

[Verse 2]
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)

[Chorus 2]
(I did it my way) from crumbs, roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) I call it how I see it niggas
(I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it niggas
(I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans
(I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
(I did it my way) takin' sacrifices kid
(I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live

[Verse 3]
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
""Shorty, go home, we about to be shooting""

[Chorus 1]
(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said

I come through in a new double R listening to smiling faces
Check out my jewelry piled in your faces
Italian air forces leather laces with the basket weave
Iron in your face so fast from the draft so sneeze
It's the nastiest, flashiest, turn girls to masochist
Cause I be giving them pain, it's a cold world, I laugh as if
Bernie Mac will be snappin' on you
But I ain't a joke; you think I'm here to entertain you
Fallen angel after them halos
Nobody moves until I say so, take the money out the safe slow
Escape route and I'm out, I cake out like Entenmann's and Breyers
The flyest

[Hook]
You got to be the flyest
I know your ass is mean, like you be strappin them
Jeans, but you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just take my pumps while standing in your pumps
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just breathe and stare while I'm pulling your hair
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You can be Nas's angel, let the largest train you but
You work it like that

Uh, Philly rap a hydro, puffing on a line slow
Your CD needs me, keep it kickin' like Del Greco
Pull up at the Delano South Beach I know
For King Solomon jury security in the Tahoe
Spandex for money, I stay on the tight
G-packs and weed stacks stay on the flight
Elbow out the left window, K's on the right
Canary out her ears, you know she playing them right
Hilton style, Billionaire Boys club
Braveheart, y'all don't want no war with us
Dump a semi out a Maybach, I made girls bust
When I hit them full thrust, full throttle

[Hook]

[Nas]
Big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life
To move an eight, every night was my passion
Pipe bombs safe from stashes, Aston's, Rolls Royces
Cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses
I got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough
Problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin'
It's at my mind, just a mystery school
Brainwash them, then fix them with my tools
Mami hit me with some moves
I'm addicted to spinning, dipping these women in different waters
Watching for dudes with tape recorders on them cause they informants
I been okay with these warmers
Girls harass me and gas me and say that I'm enormous

Niggas is up in here hittin' some of this chronic, nigga

Niggas stealin' beats and niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit, niggas wanna take everything from a nigga man
Yeah yeah yo Nas it's like this man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'
Just like niggas can't do what you do

You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it God
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
All these niggas talkin all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens

[Verse 1: Nas]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the firm
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Cris' push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro diamond roll, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes
These three words are sung

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death - the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in your system every night, now

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell

You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known

Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is

First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honies wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech

Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

(Y'all ready for Nas?
Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?
Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Rémy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

[Verse 2: Nas]
Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, ""It was Nas I used to hustle with""
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my team nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor

Queensbridge, 41st side
Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin 1010 WINS AM
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin ""Dunn"" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the Glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell

[Hook]
Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)

[Verse 2]
Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, english, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption

Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse

I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'mma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused
Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage

[Verse 2: Nas]
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full of scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage

[Verse 3: Nas]
Son's back with flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them guns come out
My cavalry woulda been through ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me
Straight savage",Nas,Nazareth Savage,

Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

[Verse 1]
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later

[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

[Verse 2]
Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage

[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

[Verse 3]
Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I
More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks?
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today

Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 1]
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level
It's not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene

Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreaming of
Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes, trying to get it like Medellin

[Verse 3]
My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rapping for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They calling it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king

I'm oblivious to you skeptics
What you hear you ain't ever hear 'til I repped it
Iridescent heroes essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message, air 'em out
Heard some people discussing my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move in style, wild, exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
""Oochie Wally"" I did
Sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed
Signed to Columbia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging about your past and
Thinking back on trips on Manhattan
Dad was rolling hotels like The Plaza
Black bellhops holding
Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Just try to be the best you, man
That's all I can say, man)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy

Big Apple my Hennessy, please)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(On the rocks, yeah)

[Verse 2]
To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirts, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper

[Verse]
If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
You're part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watchin'
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two

In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip Jose
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us

Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense

To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)
John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it
Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved
Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation
(Fuck your proclamation!)
SWAT was created to stop the Panthers
Glocks were created for murder enhancement
For hunting men, circumstances
Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
""Am I good?"" he ask, thinkin', ""But is he testin' you?""

Make you pussy, make you a snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga
Just ‘cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used
How much money the shooter got
‘Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in
What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'
I found out most of them are cowards
They hidin' behind reputations that's sour; I'm not going back

Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today

First thing that happen when you make a little paper
You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper
Till you come across some ever more flyer paper
Realize that five-star tellies are even greater
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid
‘Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling
It's a race thing how they sell blacks to bootleg shit
In fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
‘Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of going back, I'm buying the projects
But I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back

Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin'
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain, I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever

Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci, Iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', ""Damn, wish my niggas could afford this""
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried with your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real

Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?

I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back
And saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?)
It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
And black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in the New York State of Mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Intro]
Uhh.. yo
Whattup? Whattup?
It's time man (word, it's time?)
Straight up (it's time, man)
Aight, set that shit off (set it off then, nigga)
Set it off (set if off)

[Verse 1]
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building—come out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7
7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven
6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'—3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit
Fake shit—beat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends
What?

[Chorus (repeats in bridge)]
New York, New York (New York state of mind)
New York, New York (New York state of mind)

[Bridge]
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news (""Get money!"")
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase (aight?)
You know what I mean?
New York state of mind, baby (oh, yeah)
Check it out (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs
Hoodrats flashin' they tongue
Young thugs blastin' they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
'Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin'
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Outro: Nas]
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man [Goon?], one love

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)",Nas,One Mic,

In my darkest days lighting up the rightous smoke
Cause I'm dealing with this thug life crisis and can't cope
Niggas on my dick beef don't stop
Niggas asking what happed to the Firm
Did you and AZ bone Fox? No
How was it working with Dre though?
Heard you was fucking Lil Kim and Mary J, Whoa , the list goes on
There is rumors that Brandy broke my heart
The world want to know what's in the life of the prettiest Don
Nas, was Jay fucking with your baby mom's?
Was she involved with a plot, to deceive my perfect degrees of
Three hundred and sixty, he ugly she pretty that's life
Never been married eloped with dope; Music's my wife
It's true, me and 2 PAC once steped to each other
Confronted our like's and dislike's in front of Suge Knight, we left it as brothers
As a child pop's blew his weed in my face, results, mixing ether with base
I'm the rebel to America, less is the nasal voice chipped tooth bastard
What your hearing is a replica
I never had a clue, that all you dudes should be in dresses
Double edges playing both sides of the fences

Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug?
One never knows do one
The things that I've seen in the streets I'm from
One never knows do one
The stuff that I've done what I've become
One never knows do one
Am I crazy what they make me out to be or what?
One never knows...

[LAKE]
The streets say what up wit Lake, not showin his face
And did he really shoot at the Jake's?
When he just came home, and dude shot at Capone, for his necklace
Why was Lake name mentioned?
Was he reppin on the island taking phone time?
Did he get Prodigy his chain back in ""99""?
Who's writing his rhymes? He is
Do he be with Kingpin like Delson and Jesus, What was he thinking?
On Revolutionary Warfare when he said, He's a modern day Hitler
Did he shoot more niggas, Than every dude in QueensBridge?
Why his last case made the daily news in June?
Do he have the strength to unify heads from BX to Harlem?
Who did he stomp and walk naked in his Projects?
Did he get shot in his chest, never fall with no vest on shoot duke and walk off

"[Verse 1]
In the Rotten Apple, take a bite, taste the worm
Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn
Coke connection drug bust, graveyards where thugs rest
I keep my mug blessed,the evil is illegal substance sold
Roll mob deep, guns in the black Jeep
MAC-11's in Legends, cracks in the streets
Patroller, gold money-folder, gun happy soldiers
Never sober, takin' over, my blood is colder
Niggas respect violence so I become it
I'm from it, I even done it blunted, so run it

Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens
Give you what you never seen, the infs on the MAC-10
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens
Try hard and die hard
Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard
I walk at piece with a deadly shadow
They want to blow me with the double barrel, foul, no sorrow
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in the thinker, dome
Make hell your new home, with the blue chrome
Mid-State wants me, suave fellow but raunchy
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country
But only to shed tears for years
Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near
Street fightin' was cool, but in school I brought a new tool
Duelin' with the devil, a rebel, a fool

Imagine this: no guns, no knife
Just a one on one so now we gots to fight, son
Imagine this: no gun, no knife

I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep
Marked money I keep, play the benches all week
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof
Sippin' 80 proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up
I see some brothers tryin' to roll up, wishin' I could fold up
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me – I'm out

Check it out, when I'm chilling, I grab the buddha
Get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops

I'm tryin' to get this money, God
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'ma lamp, ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling ""Free the mind""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts

[Interlude]
That verse is ten years old, nine and half years old
Street's Disciple, the rebirth comin at you this year baby, it's on baby

[Verse 2]
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways
Listening close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see
We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, loaded
Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again

[Verse 3]
Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies
This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions
Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God
Religion was fast women, expensive cars

I went to my window, my window was propped
I went to my door, my door was locked
I stepped right back, I shook my head
A big black nigga's in my folding bed
I shot through the window, I broke the glass
I never seen a little nigga run so fast

And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is?
The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz

Or pass it to Horse, then that ass getting tossed
Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail
I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy that's how a nigga feel
Bust three times, throw her the peace sign, she sleep
Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks

Grab her hair slap her ass, she screaming like she dying
Make her cum four times without even trying
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying
Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat
Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them titties hang, I'll have all the bitches saying

[Verse 4: Horse]
When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying

How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it onto the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance
Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first
I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up
Outta the earth, too morbid, lean forward
Toward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class
Strictly that kush in the weed bags
Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production
Studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa

Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta' get your papes on, play on, playa

Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy
But a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking
Tied up in a knot top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals
Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's
No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings
On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus
‘Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade
Hot towel on the face, hot models who vomit
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step I 'Clorox it', keep twenty G's
On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil
True mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning
Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending
Finest females, I just came on and sprayed her

It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet, a better crew, praise God, I'm a marry you
Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
Roll me another blunt, stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
That man, that game, that thing it busts

Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks
Right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!)
End of existence, for instance
Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
Goddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it
Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo

[Intro]
To my nigga
Who brought me in this world
Ha, that's right nigga

[Verse 1]
My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day, mama was either home
Or at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone peeping out the window heated
But still I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and mom's love

[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

[Verse 2]
So many kids I knew, never knew who pop was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death
But stayed, watched me crawl 'til I took my first step
To the first grade, to my first fistfight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
""What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you're not my mommy!""
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand, ""Little me
What's in you is inside me""

[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

[Verse 3]
Uhh, my nigga
Pops told me hold my own
Pops told me value home
Could I help it poppa was a rolling stone?
Who loved the pretty brown round, outta town bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are the same now
No white lines, no trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that be pumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed

I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P

Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood, but no signs say out

Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run

You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

[Verse 3]
These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple",Nas,Purple,

Yo pussy kill me...
Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah..
Huh, huh, huh, huh..

[Verse 1]
Pussy killed me when I was born (What?)
Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying
I look at the bright side
The fact that I got a life side
Born '73 - September right Nas? (True)
Virgo child, the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round
On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (word)
Bitches even nastier, they throw at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragging 'til her baby dad went nuts (stupid bitch)
Now he looking for me, two cars deep
Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, ""You Nas peeps?""
I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that
Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble
I pissing bubbles
I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em
Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers
And basketball players, the bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat
You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?)
She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, (damn) now you a life-er
And suicide notes you write her, pussy kills

[Chorus]
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills

[Verse 2]
My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck
Studied for her Masters, part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike
'Cause James and me like I was with AZ like
Luke and Han Solo
Fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no
It's death and we real niggas, civilized Gods
And their ain't too many niggas like Nas, I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life, even
Happy for James 'cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he's lucky, we clown some
Rolling up dutchies while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze
Put his face to the TV, 'bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind?
He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind
She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing
He's having trouble breathing (gasping for air, coughing)
He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him
Yelling, ""Ain't no telling where her lips have been!""
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser than
Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding
That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging
I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it
I'm like, ""When you started acting like that? This is dumbness.""
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped
He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen
Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange
My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James

[Chorus]
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real

Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking

Talking to this cutie on FaceTime
Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility
Critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized? Why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the Mobb represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Your enemy, dunn, was internal
A disease that needs a vaccination
Plagues black seeds
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
Queensbridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early '80s, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marley was changing hip-hop
Then Marley and Shanté caught a body, UTFO
She cold, ""Roxanne's Revenge"", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the Q-U
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's Queensbridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, 'cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P

Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper-chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
They daddies faceless
Play this, by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray ""Please God, let him spit that 'Uzi in the army lining'
That 'shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining'""
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that ""nigga"" shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it
I'm Huey P in Louis V
At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
And you ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs

The same hand that punched down devils
That brought down the Towers",Nas,Queens Get the Money,
"[Verse 1]
At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fightin' Italian rival gangs, they was sniffin' glue
I was skippin' school, smokin' green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hoppin' and snatchin' jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in ways
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the nights calling, the Benz engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and niggas ballin'
I put the .22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

[Chorus]
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island

If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

[Verse 2]
Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from?
This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? who laced it?
Previous night, memories who erased it?
Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talkin' 'bout it
Singin' me praises, said I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screamin' out ""QBietnam"" the loudest
""Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team""
So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, nigga, my QU shit
Audemars watch, burn a peach Swish', new whip
Stoli' vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em
And then all hell break loose

[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed

Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker beggin' for more
It's Thorazine
Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper
Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop?
Nigga standin' there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect
Plans connect
The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast, leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia
In a schoolyard, we make it hard
What's poppin' y'all?
We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all?
They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall

I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit out of David Dinkins
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills
There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'

Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal
Shots in your body make you see-through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life bid, never cry niggas
Floss when they up north

Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor
Come through one man gang like The Predator

Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed
When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight
Know how much force this is

Nothin' but horses, kid

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Verse 1: Nas]
3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, what y'all know about this..
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby

That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

[Hook: Emily]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money

Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

[Hook: Emily]
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa

[Verse 3: Nas]
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggas gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

[Hook: Emily]

Emily harmonizes as Nas talks:
""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man.""",Nas,Reason,Emily King

I think I can remember some...

[Verse 1]
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

[Hook]
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you

[Verse 2]
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted

Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners
(Ay, yo, yo, who that?), they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

Where dogs shit and piss
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics
Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LPs
What can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?

Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
""Jesus"", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up
The armies is school teaching smart ways to kill
I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool, the chronic's a fool
Got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills
For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters
My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton

Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared
I don't care if no one's spared in..

Listen up, gangstas and honies with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog—whatever they call you—God, just listen
I spit a story backwards—it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one, screamin', ""shoot don't please""
I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""go he there""
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""no hell,"" she talkin' about, ""me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said: ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill.""

Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, 'cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet

You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?

Have your own cash, own your own Benz

I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, every day is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must open up his eyes
To the set backs and rise
Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds, is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo

You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

[Outro: Skit]
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that man, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like
Whatever you want out of life
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on
That's what this country's about
This is, this is what my country is, and my country's a motherfucker",Nas,Rule,Amerie
"[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said

[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

Nas: ""Di-sci-ple"" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: ""You remind me of my dude, help me get them all""

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em

[Verse 1:]
Yea, they dug me out the soil and the mines of the motherland
Now I'm displaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yea, guess that's how we got here, slave trade and the diamond trade
Every childs afraid when his mother and father get sprayed
Forced in the army, young killer brigade
Get's a new name, then he gets his nose glued
Till his mind can't take what he's going through
Lookin' in the dirt for that ice so blue
Then the royal family the ice go to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed
As I rap with my platinum chain
When you shop for me you think about the misery?
The same way we made apartheid history
We can do the same way to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine right?

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
My VVS glimmers on my chest, 200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how how people starve to death, when God blessed the land that lacks the harvest
The stones are quality, but their homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks, but she mad at me
Tear drop shape, ugh, perfect clarity
It shocks so many are killed annually
Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from they homes, mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives
Keep a Jesus Piece to be fly
But there was a time back in the day when they called that shine

One .44, two .45's
Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open let your Gi-Glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
Ayo the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now

Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God just save the life that the Devil sold
See It Was Written but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

[Verse 2]
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two to four
Niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord
Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Somethin' in the air yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin' - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-Cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 1]
It's sort of like the conclusion to Color Purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one-time on pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one: If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from, gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a Prince in a Palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But who's the foul one to make his nose take a freeze?
And got enough gall to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters
Collect calls from lifers, Astoria wars with Cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 2]
They say the arms of Nicky Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz?
Fuck what they teach in class, I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Living practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, folded up money and mad clips
Are stacked right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hughes Brothers motion picture
Niggas getting open, crews roping older niggas
April fools, they laugh, the jokes on the benches
Seeds outside, my nigga spoke on his sentence

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 3]
My right-handers never play too close to cameras
It's night time, scandalous, circle the loud gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The Beast making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless
'Cause, son, it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and
Pakistanians are took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet, known for spending pies up
What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favors?
Locking real niggas down and letting fake players
Roam around the projects, it's lyrical logic
I dilute, the weak can inject the right composite
When plotting on murderous schemes
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly
Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase
Without production I'm worthless
But I'm more than the surface
Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40
I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me
I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students
Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music
Was lovin' women you'll never see
All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities
Damn, look at the jealousy!
Lucky me, I meet some beauties
Make you wanna shoot me
Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie
Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes
Get married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G
Don't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed
One of my exes could be your next, dog—trust me, don't test

With my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres

The sly Fox, cyclops
We locked in an idiot box
The video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna, Dr. Mindbender
Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder
Slave culture, game's over
What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan
The fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and fox-trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)

Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine

Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box

O'Reilly? Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, setting them up

Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us
What is their net worth?
They're going to try to censor my next verse
Throw them off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse
While I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house
They figured us out, why a nigga go south?
It's either he caught a body
Don't sleep, they're watching
I watch CBS, and I see BS
Trying to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS)

They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?
The back door deals on oil fields?
How is Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm
Then let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n
I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem
Only fox that I loved was the Red one
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one
Red rum, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus
And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches

Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work

Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash

Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast

Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never

If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear""
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance, to the alliance
Of underworlds killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green, and pass it around, pass it around

Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

Wanna get high, come smoke with me
Smoke with me, light it up

Damn, nigga, take this weed, I'm 'bout to go over to my bitch house, get my fuck on, nigga! Y'all niggas stay up!

Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up

Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit

Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed

Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 1: Nas]
Top of the world is what I'm aimin' at
These niggas is flamin' gats at my circle
I catch you, my first reaction's to hurt you; I'll hit your bird, too
Two in your scalp, then you out, your thug crew is out
Blood oozin' out, some servin' caine
Knowin' nothin' about this murder game
It's easily told but hard to hear
When niggas finally find out it's real
That's when they heart pumps fear
The real remain, the weak will disappear
My words are 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear
911 style sits on your mind like chrome
Let's say your brain's a V12, put it in drive, let it roam
What color? Might as well make it the same as your dome
You need your thoughts together means destination is unknown
As we travel on this road, an infinite path
I get into this math, drop and get intense for the cash
Will I be subject to kill? Live my life by the gat?
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back

I know a lot of fiends by their first name, livin' in Queens
A lot of cats gettin' stuck for they chains
Holdin' dirty guns, the young old dirty ones
Runnin' wild, nigga, I raise hell above ground
Live in sin, holdin' rocks, Benjamin Grimm
Figure once I got knocked, it would end—never that
They try to tell me I don't love my own
The thugs know, they ride my zone, like The Cyclone
Trademark for Coney Isle, yeah, they know me now
I'm givin' niggas fake hugs, phony smiles
Stack profits, you know how niggas on the block get
Try to give you dap just to stare at your pockets
Crews advance, nothin' new, just the rules of the land
You couldn't tell if they wolves or lamb (Ha, word)
You could fight like a few, there's a few that ran
Or you could feed them and lose your hand
What you wanna do?

To transcend into spiritual essence, in Allah's arms you restin'
To Him we pray for my peeps
Louie Lloyd Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sonny back in the day
""Get that money, yam,"" he used to say
Not only nice with hands but street smarts, he was twice a man
I try to understand life's deep plot, I think of Weewop
Shikeisha, they both was mad nice on the rock
They woulda went pro, but only God, he only knows why not
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers be not clean
You come around, he start snappin' on you, makin' a scene
Kept the lye, cool nigga, warm heart, and stayed fly
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face
Are you nearby or lookin' on, just from a distant place?
My thoroughbreds, Black Ed, quiet but real
Expect to see your black Jeep come fly over the hill
In the spirit of Richie Lou, tribute
Remind the world of the crime that NY pigs do, we miss you
Never forget you, Harry and Sonia
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier
T.J. Black, better known as Killer
I can't replace you, but in me

Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was them
Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they was into dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars

[Hook]
We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars

[Verse 2]
Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy Bee battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggas was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggas talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars

[Hook]
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out

[Verse 3]
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you

Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay

Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving ""Shorty, hi"", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on

[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
‘Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossing with Stoute, he had the gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washing her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hitting it raw, tasting it, wilding out of my character
Taping it, Tyra Banks face with Faiths lips
Giving head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting
P-11's, ACP shells for blasting
Caught him with his spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance
His maid cried ""No"", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought ""What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision""
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet again

[Verse 2: Nas]
Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fastlane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screaming ""Yo, we almost crashed!""
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death",Nas,Story Board,The Game

Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

Don status, dope fiends got syringes
Poppin' out their arm scratching
I remember park jams

Smellin' reefer way before purple haze
Private stock peer nigga with ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted wild niggas lickin' shots in the air

Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nastradamus and Blitz

Embryo of the ghetto born face and time
Niggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?
Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's cause I see the past grimmly
That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window
Watched the buddah clouds linger
Pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways
Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate
Like the barrel on the 38 snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs
When death calls who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

(Chorus)",Nas,Street Glory,P.O.P. (Rapper)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggas from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple

[Nas]
Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions
That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you""
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple

[Hook]

[Nas]
Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples

"[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ay fellas
I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put the petroleum jelly on your face
Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get them!

[Verse One: Nas]
Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin', but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma

[Verse Two: Nas]
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer, told you: ""Y'all sloppy gangsters"", saying:
""Nas is this, and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: ""That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting"", hey {*echo* x4}

[Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes]
Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma

[Outro: Quan, (Busta Rhymes)]
You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe

"[Intro]
But that's the whole, tragic, point my friends!
What would I do if I could suddenly feel
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for a while
Tell me what, what, what would I do if I could feel?

[Verse 1]
I was young, I was survivin' the times
Waitin' for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hopin' I'm next
Wantin' bracelets, never hada rope on my neck
Unless I was holdin' Taiyeh chain – Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us, you warned us
If you came back and we still on the corners, we goners
Movin' on to move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block
‘Cause this 40 Side where they say shorty rhyme
Tragedy, he used to come through all the time
I'm talkin' Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house buyin'
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy just gettin' some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinkin', ""Wow, she moved me!""
Same girl then right now's a groupie
Back then she was like the star in a movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man lookin' like touch it, he shoot me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder, could they tell? How did they know?
Sixteen years later, here I go

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""

[Verse 2]
I'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch, nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needin' a check, man?
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, ""What's all this commotion?""
Went plat, mad bottles I'm toastin'
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""

[Verse 3]
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
Uh, but back to the matter at hand
‘Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steerin' the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""

[Verse 1]
It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck
Niggas is buck,"" mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo he should have ducked""
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for rilla, I'm all high
It's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life clock
The beast'll time ya, cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Bursting, blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me

[Chorus]
To the suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 2]
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless, slaughter
Nautica Down, frames look petite
Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Roll the two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The wedding of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you with, lucci or drama?
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya

[Chorus]
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah
It justifies Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting gem stars, words in my mic type receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'

Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezing executioner
Winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxing, my bitches, they be laughing
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini
Flipping mad pies, low price
I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
Emcees are crawling out every hole in the slum

Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singing Reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy as a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia
For wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither
Like Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that

Yo, the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's
Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

It was '87
Crack money was ""Ghetto Heaven""
Niggas gettin' it
Every block rise to perfection
Green tops, boulders and bottles
Soldiers who follow leaders
You owed 'em dollars
Know that tommorrow you might not see it
Packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked
All the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked
That's other niggas territory had fiends in the cheese line
They told them fiends calm down, ten dollars each dime
They never scared of Po-Po, was only one patrol car
They wasn't up for crack and I was up on the chin of Pa
Watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin'
But one kid was into takin'
Had dreadlocks wasn't Jamaican
Fort green he laid
First nigga I ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade
Lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood
Dodgin' and runnin'
The glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin'
They went to war, Godbless Rita, got shot by mistake
Niggas got knocked by them Jakes
Homicide suit and tie cops, Mayor Koch, screams in rage
Niggas so thugs got pits rocking thick chains
Stick-up niggas so thug they got pits with sick names
Clicks got bigger, extortion cats wasn't hearin' it
But he was regulatin'
A ghetto king, now he levatatin'
They say he smiled in his casket
This ends the first chapter of another Nas classic

Yeah I'mma help you nigga, cause I see evil's callin' you
Sick thoughts make you wanna take Ki's from other ballin' crews
Top of the world's all he views
A puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules
Fuckin' wit' me here's what I do
Try to sell your freedom I'm accustomed to
You could ball wit' me or get arrested too
It's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands
Twenty to L' what's your plan take your grams
You bought you a Lexus, BBS spendin' Abrahams
Never learned your lesson, choose the right direction
Thin line from life and death and my man checked in
A motel, same one as a young G he know well
Crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run
But shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done
Nobody to run to, what succumb to
My nigga just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street

[Hook]
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Yeah it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should

[Verse 3]
Little Gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds
The kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list
Shorty who shot 'em ran knowing niggas would snitch
Five years passed he ain't been in the hood since
Shot this nigga over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed
Time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle
Least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his
Nigga said he don't got it, so he blast the kid
Escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream
Or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream
Seeing money's face starin' at him
In black space feelin' hands touchin' him
Wake up it got too much for him
Once liked to be alone
Until he started hearin' groans and seein' things
Now it's time to go home
Niggas shocked to see him
Gave him respect what he was missin'
All the way from VA his aunt yell ""He hate to listen""
So he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love
Then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs
He hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up
Now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up
Psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine
Haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene

Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

[Verse 2]
She edu-ma-cated, she said she related to the Asian
Ethic persuasion, the sex is amazin'
Never bought her a Birkin, my night-time nurse
May be more like a surgeon, nice on the eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block that I would service
Said, ""It's straight,"" we need a place up in Jamaica Estates
And she was like, ""Oh no"" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, I be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evel Knievel, on the soul cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a Czar
Now she hit the town with the legal Escobar, she's my—

[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

[Verse 3]
We fresh outta the Met Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best-dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes, no trespassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids, but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost, back in the crib, some avocado toast
Laid-back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin', startin' to think about children
And bringin' 'em in the world with Kim Jong illin'
But since I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willin', she's willin', we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are, in this Western Civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor",Nas,Tanasia,

Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out
Lost respect for those cracked out
Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang
It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would
First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin
That we was home alone tappin
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya

[Nas]
Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit
Hold your head little man, y'all can't tell me shit
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss
Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York
Talk to this hottie with my niggas who quick to blast you
If you old cats, to these niggas, they harass you

[Millenium Thug]
Hey yo cuz, growin up, I almost shattered my plans
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time
A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes
Only twelve in this hell where kids die
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly
My Range shift by, I peel the road up
With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest
Wild as a teenage thug

[Millenium Thug]
Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggas
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that
Yo where your mack at? I got mine
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine
Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with
Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen
Under my glove shit rocky
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine
No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people

And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy

I want to dedicate this song right here
To Jonathan Jackson and George Jackson
Peace to those brothers
I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm
Eighty years
Come home nigga
Come home, niggas

I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tips in my Mag'
To send these redneck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?

Huh? Would you testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs
But will you ride with me?

You understand my struggle
That's what you claim right?

Then get your aim right
And get your game tight

Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing ho and shit
Fuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloading it, heh
Like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit, heh

Fire spitter, I ain't never met a higher nigga
Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless
Mansion, marble foyer
I can afford a closet in alphabet order
A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega
British Knights sneaker, my C so ill
That, man, I get chills when I look at my Christian Diors, they kill
D is for Dries Van Noten
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
D cups, tequila and blunts
Weed, women, and liquor
Depending on the day is a different mission
They not knowing, they wanna know what he got on
The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up for him
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of G, the gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it
.44s never could miss him, coming to see us
Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
We blowing trees, tell me, don't it feel good, nigga?

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?

Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
Fuck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who clapping
Nike boot, what I eat him, he like food
Pulled out the barrel
Four-fifths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt
While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter
Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack I'm faceless like a iron mask
They get away quick, traceless, lying back, liars pass
I breathe deep like Lamaze class
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

Look, I don't have that much time, candidly, I'm in divorce
Rumors, DUIs, in and out of court
Different judges, assault charges hovers on your boy
Other niggas' wives lust to be under covers with your boy
Y'all don't want an angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO, man
I'm only 36 but if it's— point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude
Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artist on the masters controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product'll be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef
I used to open off making fifty G's
But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze
My larynx'll serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

I pull a string on the lamp and shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and
Alky on the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving nogging
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden
Nah bitch, Nas is In the real deal
Food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags
Full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes saying ""Nas, you're one lucky bastard""
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past ya

[Verse 2]
Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrods in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the Tundra
Get humbled or disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks, you must wanna die
But you fronting, why? When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It’s like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it",Nas,The Black Bond,

I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited

Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin'
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path

I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses

I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake

Much more smarter much, more strategic Scholarships
And hollow tips a, lot of walkin caskets They
Talk a good one but there's never no action And
I'm the type to poison ya sista twist, her Through
Wit her put, the gun in your face and make you hit her Make
You quiver -when they silhouette of a Don Benson, Light
Up a Cu-ban recite, a few psalms Enlighten
You quick teach, you how a king wins wars Keep
Your ears to the street love, your enemies more 'Cuz

I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

[Nas]
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress

[Hook]

[Nas]
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words from a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

That you don't see much, sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son, I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate when you rolling with papes

Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames flew from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half permed, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon pace
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggas smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love takes over lust
Despite the damage to Destiny

My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY'RE BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Beamers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
""Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge, I'm bout to go loca""
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over, my nigga Hav gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real

They started chattin', was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed them pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin'
There the girls go, hurry up we out
In the 940, me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

[Chorus: Havoc]
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

[Outro: Woman]
Q.B.C., Queensbridge motherfucker
Roping niggas up
Cause our clique is thick
Another day, another dollar
More money, more murder

Aiyo, this is big Nas
I wanna give a shout-out to my man Premo, you know?
From Gang Starr, no doubt
Lil' Dap, Jeru, Melachi, the whole crew (Foundation)
Queensbridge Crew, forty busters, shorty busters
Vernon Posse, Good Fellas, you know how that go
My man Ill Will rest in peace forever, God
Tragedy, MC Shan and the whole crew, you know how that go
Marley Marl, and my man Big Bo locked up in the piece
And my man Drawz, you know

The, the mic is open, yo
On the Stretch Armstrong showw, hosted by Bobbitooooooo

[Verse 1: Nas]
How should I start this?
How should I begin, to sin?
Grab the microphone and my rhymes'll win
Wheel of Fortune, spin, around
Check it out, I'm not a rap clown
Get smacked down by the fuckin' four pound in your dome
Hit you with the nick plate chrome
Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' home
Off the top of my head, yo, I'm a blunt head
Police... Police want a nigga dead
But I'm not goin' out like that, black
I kick the actual facts in solar
Cold as a Polar Bear, I swear, word to Will
But I'mma chill, rhymes'll kill
Niggas know the style when I freak the profile
Asiatic Child, yo
Grand Wizard on the side of me
Get on the mic and bless the M-I-C

[Grand Wizard]
Ayio, but I'mma pass it off to my man Six-Nine
Kick it one time

[Verse 2: Six-Nine]
Hey, yo, Six-Nine a true to life nigga
Yo, my style is iller, iller than Halle Berry's figure
Niggas don't fuck with the Six-Niner
Shorty, watch your mouth, I smack you back in your vagina
Here's the reefer, crack the Sunrise Tequila
Kill the Margarita, here's a 50, get some more cheeba
The ghetto trooper, so spark up the Bu-Buddha
My thoughts'll stay nasty like the underground sewers
To be the man, you gotta beat the man
It ain't nothin' startin' over here but nothin' mark my Timberlands
You want static? Let's have it
Niggas who flow like the Atlantic will sink like the Titanic
Since birth, I was thinkin' too fast
My first beef was with the doctor when he smacked me on my ass
The trigger man, I'm crazy like Sam
My skill's so ill like a white chick with a suntan

[Verse 3: Nas]
Check it out now
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis: my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
But, chill! Bless the microphone and say peace
So, Sudan, take the microphone in your hand
Kick the flim flam

[Sudan]
So, check it out
I'm gonna give a strong shout-out, this is to my man Will
A little somethin' I done wrote up for my man Will
It goes somethin' like this, it's called Rock-a-bye Homeboy
Check it out

[Verse 4: Sudan]
Queensbridge, when will the drama ever cease?
I'd like to say peace, Willie, and rest in peace
A cool brother who's all about justice
I still can't understand how he left us
Well... he's gone and life goes on, you know
We had a crew, but one by one we go
Memories of his face that was full of joy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye homeboy
Reminiscin' with the brothers standin' on the block
Never talked a lot, never was a big shot
It's so hard to say goodbye, a sad song
And damn, I can't believe my man's gone
Diggin' back in the days when we used to laugh
Now its a memory that's haunted from the past
Poor Willy, its a shame how the ghetto got him
And word is bond - I wanna cry when I think about him
Three bullets to his back on his own block
Not a way to go, killed by the buckshot
Queensbridge, wake and up and smell the air
And stop killin' like a villain, like you don't care
Remember Willie and the times we had with joy?
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Quensbridge style!
Rock-a, Rock-a bye

[Verse 5: Jungle]
My skills are ill like the prez with a plan
My brothers run from Sudan then the Ku-Klux-Klan
Like a kamikaze, Saddam Hussein then won
Feel the buns of a nun, put tricks for funds and chill (Wooo-ooooh)
I spill a verse so you can understand
I kill rappers off quicker than a motherfuckin' Mic Man
And when it comes to a battle, I stand out tall
Like the man who played the man on The White Shadow

One two, one two

[Nas]
What you gonna do when the flavour's comin' after you?
Grand Wizard, take my side
Grab the microphone and I'mma rock it up like...

[Verse 6: Nas]
To my man Jungle, dwellin' in the jungle
Where must we go? Where must we wander?
Deep out the skies come the MC Nas
Not to surprise, but to civilize
All the dumb men wanderin' around the streets
Listenin' to a nigga rappin' on fly beats
I just kick the mad Phillie style
Get buckwild 'cause you know my style
I could run a word, kick it to a herd
Make 'em turn into a rich man, increase the plan
The master plan, yo, I'm buggin' out
'Cause the weed got me buggin', plus the Guinness Stout
Grand Wizard, yo, you my physical
Why don't you mic the make, make the microphone miserable?

[Verse 7: Grand Wizard]
It's the G, the G, the G, the G, the Wiz
You know that our culture's gone get theirs
I got my man Nasty on the side of me
My man Six-Nine, you know we're not hidin', G
I am the man that'll break it down
I'll break it all down 'cause I got the sound
I got Queensbridge backin' me
The Tec and everythin', I'm comin' strapped, G
It's like that, check it out, uh huh

[Verse 8: Nas]
Yo, check it out, y'all
Money and murder, money and murder
The sick shit you heard comin' from my motherfuckin', my swerve
The words are poetic
I sound energetic when I'm blunted or Moët'd
My microphone's upsetted 'cause I'm crazy
Now you know, never lazy
Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can
Don't give a fuck if I gotta shoot a policeman
Pluckin' a church and snatch a fuckin'...
Nah, can't be flippin' like that
'Cause you niggas try to jock the style
But I left that shit to get the new shit to flow like the Nile
Now you can't catch up, G
'Cause I got the new styles on the M-I-C
I keep gettin' newer, can't step to a
Nigga from the Bridge, so, you keep that shit
And I'mma flip the script next year
And my real name is Nasir
Can't spell it 'cause I say it too clear
The alphabets are not enough words or letters to use
When it comes to mics, I bruise
I just go with the magical mystic flow
Niggas don't know, that's word to the man Bo
I get Illmatic with the style that's insane
Comin' out a fuckin' murderer's brain
Grand Wizard, please take this mic from me
Before I bug the fuck out and wind up D-A-E-D
Wait, D-E-A-D, I'm buggin', fuck that shit

(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours

[Verse 2: Nas]
To my man Ill Will
God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens
God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]

Break it down
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening

The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with

[Verse 2]
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going
And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life
For the thieves who come out at night

This bitter land
Watered with my soul
The fruit it bears
Leaves me so cold
This bitter land
Does nothing for love
This bitter land
Brings pain from above, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, running on the concrete across the train tracks
The devil is behind me
In the ghetto where's you'll find me, it's where I stays at
Cop shot us up, he get a medal then retire
But it never will define me
Write a letter to the president, whoever in control of the society
Tell 'em stop riding me, stop driving us into a suicidal ideology
Tryna feed my seeds
Getting high on weed, study my degrees
Stay fly, getting paper
With some dead white people faces in the circle of spaces around the green
I'ma lean, taking Percs It’s a bitter Earth
Is a nigga cursed? Am I blessed? See what I mean
It's a test, life is a test
Life is like a hood, hard
Trying not to fall between the cracks
In the cracks it's so dark, and the dark
Seems more appealing than the light in the land
Where you gotta fight
Catch a body in the night, we need a plan
To survive, to survive the land
Survive the storm, when it comes through
Either you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to
Look what it's come to, so what you're gonna do?

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu]
This bitter land is far too real
This bitter land, it does not heal
Cause in the land skies are grey
But we fight the storms that come our way
A boy who strives to be a man
Must push to lead with all he can
Oh, this bitter land
Oh, bitter land
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
This bitter land, can't stop my fight

"[Intro: Nas]
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read ""Love God""
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 3: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy

Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars

Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin'
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin'
Young don, now they know they weakness

Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin' now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like
Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official

But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete
So you can be an architect design appartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set I'm never on a chick I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet it's just the booze
Check my niggas, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggas runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down
Now it's back to the same old shit, you know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines, I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit, bloodied up, scream that I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Well first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot
Deuce deuce, had my pockets full of bullets I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queensbridge always got shot up
No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggas aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old english red bull and blue bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit fuck it we was broke
Little badass, my nigga Rap sat me down, like this
He said: P you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind of the street
And it stuck in the back of my head, though
I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen niggas get cut up

If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me

Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 2]
It's been so long, can’t remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride…

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 3]
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word ""fresh"" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more",Nas,Trust,

[Verse 1]
January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
""It can't get better than this""
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
""Smack me and I smack you back""
Sounded like the answer to the ""I Ain't No Joke"" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

"[Intro]
Yeah, real conversation for that ass
(It's what they want) huh
(It's what they want) what you say? Can't hear you man
(It's what they want, huh) speak the fuck up
(It's what they want) word
(It's what they want)

[Verse 1]
Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a MAC-10 over a TEC
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""Nigga, light that""
Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?'
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

[Chorus]
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh)
(It's what they want) (it's what they want)

[Verse 2]
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your click roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting, marinating
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

[Chorus]
(It's what they want, huh) fuck it
(It's what they want, huh) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh) fuck it

[Verse 1]
Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some nigga
Mumblin' shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through

[Chorus]
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""
.. we elope

""They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan
They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life

[Verse 1]
Uhh, yeah, wow..
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, 'cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let 'em kill me...

[Verse 2]
Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot
Escobar, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us

[Chorus]
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me

Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's just a matter of days before they try to take me...",Nas,Untitled,
"Uhh, oooooh baby, baby
Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
Now slowly, thinking of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fucking pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (ho)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a

[Hook]
Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be me son, I'm the one and only
But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concerning this mic profession, turn your direction

[Verse 2]
You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick
That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fucking C-section
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can't be me, I'm trying to walk a straight line
Why they trying to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line
Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
At the Player's Ball, Brioni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't crying laughing, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinking?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inkling that you coming for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
Take me out, try try try, but you

Literally rich since nine-six
Still woulda hit a enemy with a TEC in nine-six

Escargot, my car fresh from the dealership
Esco alias, my escrow grow daily
It's the freshest Air Max wearer, yes
Ejaculatory depression after sex
And that mean after I nut, don't touch me, no questions
Unless she's a restless spirit then I can heal it
Spend a lot of time together, I know her feelings
But you fightin' what the essence of a woman is
I respect you, my love's limitless
But what are you becoming?
You wanna be the man or the woman? Play your position
Mornin' or night I'm lickin' the pudding ain't I?
Since my days of St. Ides
Pullin' out box cutters to bang opps who ain't us
To Bentley Continentals, see the man I is
Hand-to-hand hustlers always claiming they ran The Brizz
The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son

With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't buy cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon, still

Yo, the Lord is my shepard

Before they choose an education
But once dead their ain't no awakenin'
So like once said, life ain't for fakin
Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em?

Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan

Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth

Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'

[Hook:]
Okay, you wanna play rough?!
(gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes)
Okay yo, we could play rough!

[Verse 2:]
Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat?  are they lookin' for me?
But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-11 Glock spits 17 shot clips
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat
Back up in the street
Watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat
Empty every shell in their direction
Its you, I should've guessed it!
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Walked in his house, smackin' him up, ""what you talkin' about?"" he said
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone
Fuckin' with me, you should've known
I'll have 'em write ""stupid nigga"" on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin' me
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin' you niggas with nothin'
Left him dead, engine runnin'
You the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin'
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats
Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react
Eye for an eye, cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat?
""a cop man"", let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds!
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Dont explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said......
Okay, so we gonna play rough!

"[Chorus 1: Keon Bryce]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth as Hall & Oates
Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me

[Chorus 2: Keon Bryce]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feeling uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
Cause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing
Newcomer called Verbal Assassin running with
Nothing but the worst type, worst fight
When we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging
In my new car bought from entertainment
Champagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

[Chorus 1: Keon Bryce]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

Highways are landing strips for planes to land
Before the Wright brothers planned aerodynamics
Now I am chilling 20 karats like a savage
Not embarrassed
Buy what I'm copping while I'm shopping out in Paris
Parasites try to steal the culture (True)
While chem trails and satellites hover over
Feds is watching, real niggas ask this is so (Ask this is so)
Still the 5th is loaded (5th is loaded)
For these lawyers who be ripping soldiers off in court
They don't get em all, they just take your money and lie
Have you sitting up north (Foul)
Study the law (Word)
Get your appeal (True)
Soon you back on the street the shit'd get real (Facts)

[Verse 1]
Staring at the face of my watch, its like a crystal ball
With the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck, ‘cause I know where the missile fall
‘Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small
Went to my man's crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up, his voice whispered, ""Nigga, ball!""
So I smoke the finest, (85 for the ocean liners?)
I do it for the have-not's, I'm at spot
That resembles screen savers on your lap tops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue FILA velour's suits
Boss smooth, the only thing I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a lawsuit
All true in living God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts

[Verse 2]
Whose crew was realist? Shot up the movie theaters?
Times Square '88, whose crew was in it?
(Photographed was?) sittin' on wood wicker chairs
40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares
Punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air
Hangin' out a Cutlass Supreme window like ""Bitch, come here""
Girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses
Like, ""Who you calling bitch?! Little black bastards!""
We had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad
Drug dealers in the crazy Jag looking crazy mad
They all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men
But we was all Black seeds as Fred Williamson
It was so simple, now I'm reflecting in this gold Enzo
Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet
So now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin'

And hope somebody learn somethin' from it

They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith is with Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found

I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Verse 3: Nas & Both]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found

This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!

Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up

[Verse 1: Nas]
They never realized how real Nas is so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'll be sticking you
The Mag inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do

Now, how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?)
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to ""Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seatbelt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from the Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato

Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do

Some niggas watch you (uhh)
See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself 'nobody's taking mine'
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, ""Where's the hundred grand?"", strippin' her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin' ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

Seems the closer we get to the truth State Troopers or Feds

Cause living next door to Demi Moore, plus I'm black
Plus I want vengeance for the poor who's attacked daily

To my dogs.. wherever you are

[Verse 1]
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah..

[Chorus: Nas]
Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

[Verse 1: Nas]
In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses – it's all poison

[Chorus 2: Nas]
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

[Verse 2: Nas]
When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial
Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

[Chorus 3: Nas]
Yo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

[Interlude: Nas]
Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong!

[Verse 3: Nas]
The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday ""hell-day""
‘Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

[Chorus 4: Nas]
It's all poison: all of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MCs? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

[Verse 4: Nas]
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, ‘cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name? Where you from?
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom; give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on a nigga's dreams
They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you: now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember:

[Verse 2b: Nas]

Queens bridge murders kings live merciless
Heartless crazy mercedes the projects young killas OG's enemies targets
Blow weed henessee more beef let it be
No chance of wetting me I hold heat in the streets
Rolls royce drop top crusing where the women be
Last nigga fucked around hes a hood memory

All them tough guys is wanksters they ??? me in their songs
Im a braveheart till death so I got to die strong
A big man that's troublesome and follow no rules
Run through crews after smoking blunts and sippin on brews
Disrespecter pistol whippin hustlers for their cheddar
The deebo of the rap game but walk with a beretta
My heart is made of stone my eyes is filled with blood

"Uhh, where am I going?
Where am I? Where the hell am I?
Yo, it's ill...

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily, I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, tequila bottle in my left arm
Like Christion, watching my life go
Can´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let 12 spin, hop in my Benz
Push it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit wit'
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed, I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me, I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo, nigga, watch me

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell these niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take 'em to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark, homie
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze, blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas, expect kilos
But what they not seeing is police expect RICO
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up, blastin' A.C., going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
Yo, I'll ride to the end of the road, if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, I try to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start to feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib, I'm tired...

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already

I recommend when your kid turn ten
Let him hear Spice 1, made plenty noise
Positive K, Father MC, the Skinny Boys

Where are they now?

[Verse 1: Nas]
At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black card
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Homes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't The Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

[Chorus: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung, without love?
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
""Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous""
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, 'cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it, I'ma blow it with you
It ain't The Truman show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love

I slow dance with the Devil
Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart
Lot of blood gon' splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass
But y'all ain't never seen nothing

To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit
Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick
The big Benz, I'ma model ya chick
With Zac Posen, cash froze her

Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it

Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financier, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma TV's or first roll
Diversified dough in my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock and Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick

A vet stylin' in Met Gala, tuna salad from La Scala
Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer
God, it hard to quit the bottom feeder, lobster eater
When I fast, I see Elijah's features
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nah it's cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me

Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep

Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga
I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news
I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that

It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Heard you got your master's
Did college up, never looked back, now that's what's happening
And it's good to see you made it out the hood
With a degree, a true man with passion
Now you could enter the so-called ""White Man's Society""
And go right past 'em
Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face
But it's always absent
There he go, that's him
Eating flan and ambrosia, watch on his arm, golden, laughin'
Try to get his attention, but he's flinching
Guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention
We were neighbors some time ago
He was kinda cold, in this restaurant, full of his kind and more
He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know
His side of the city where he resides, so
I had to go, I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
Hate so-called ""intellectuals""
No balls, he suggests we vote
He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks
He want to lecture folks 'cause he professional
And he suggest that we don't sell dope
And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you?

[Chorus: David Rainer]
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

I'm Idi Amin, I'm Marcus Garvey
H. Rap Brown, I'm Muhammad Ali
I'm Reginald Lewis, George Washington Carver
I'm Nas with incredible music, let's do it
Thinking of a master plan
Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster
Watching niggas argue, chillin' on my bar-stool
With my Hell Up in Harlem hat in hand
With a girl named Pat
She more than a waitress to order your drink with
She divorced a banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile, she give an order to kill
You get caught and robbed, we could see your walk is off
You could lose your rhythm when you outta the gutter for a while
You easily go to soft from hard
Now we all about hustlers, number runners, hoes and sharks
And we all know the code of the block
And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit
'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks?
Brother, don't start, go build your Noah's Ark
You could float to the end of the world, and pretend what you not
But I know what you are
While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot
While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
Matter of fact, you're an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished
But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense
So who the fuck are you?

[Chorus: David Rainer]
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?

Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

Look here see
Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation
Microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam
Now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand
What a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
""He said one glance is all it took ya
She's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather
And at this rate we'll never get her.""
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party
""What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang.""
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said ""See you later.""
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silouhette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, ""The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president.""

Well what do ya say

Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?

Look here see
I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypress
One Eyed Charlie
He only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'
She says, ""Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story.""
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, ""It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?"" She says, ""Bill Gates.""
What are ya born 77 or 78?
She says, ""Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times,"" claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? ""Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx.""
Now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell
He's Kool Herc

Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

Listen up sweetheart
Now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air

She said if you really love me I'll come back alive",Nas,Who Killed It?,

[Intro: Anthony Hamilton]
Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 2: Nas]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into bestiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 3: Nas]
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

(""I wrote my way out"")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

[Verse 1: Nas]
I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power—just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

[Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin';
""Oh, you think you smart?""—Blah!—start bleedin'
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, ""Pssh—you'll get 'em right back.""
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
""Damn, you got no chill,"" fuckin' right—I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?

[Bridge: Aloe Blacc + sample + together]
(""I wrote my way out"")
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm

"[Intro: sample]
We use the word everyday
Now we don't know the capacity of this word
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)
Because we did not break down the capacity
Of the same what (the same word)
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness
We've been taught wrong

[Verse 1]
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta, strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back
To be a Fortune 500 CEO, it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies is hiring blacks
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue
If it offends you, it's meant to, it's that simple

[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 2]
Yo, I was thinking a little bit
What would it take to authenticate my nigganess?
Ball ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership?
Aww, that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit?
We having too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with
Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leaning
Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life
If you fight, they just give in, people used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga, and shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'Til Noble Drew Ali started dropping that consciousness

[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 3]
My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor
When it came to getting paper, who the hell was gon' train us?
Oppression couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use of ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one

[Interlude: sample]
Every word we use, it has a capacity
And if you don't understand the words you're using
And understand the capacity of it
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you
That you don't even know, or even conscious of

[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject

Tryna erase me from y'all memory

Speak my name and breathe life in me

I hit P and them
I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know...
But I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo
Check it out, check it out how it went

[Verse 1]
It was just cool like, smooth night with my jewels bright
Goons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft, mixing hash and dro
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to business
Shit about to go down with some foul niggas
What the voice said, ""What up, pop? Who want it?""
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say ""Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'""
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me with silly shit, call Rico

Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather""

Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?

What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah

Smack your mom, relaxed and calm, then mack your mom
In a casket, you'll get your fashion on
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' with Nas
Remember anyone can get it at anytime
Lames'll swear by your name, when they lie
Get hit with the lone star, ripped where your bones are
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1?
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
Merk you wit your own shooters
All you want is a name, pissed and insane
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen

Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

[Chorus: Ginuwine & Nas]
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice (yeah)
Now let's say you owe me something
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again

[Bridge: Ginuwine]
I put the shackles on your feet (you owe me)
I think you owe me some (you owe me)
The shackles on your feet (you owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (you owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night (End of the night, babe)
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion

[Outro: Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
(Say what's your price, baby)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something (oh)
(You owe me something, oh yeah)
I said shorty, say what's your price
(You owe Nas)
Just to back it up
(You owe Ginuwine)
You can hold my ice
(You owe Timbaland)
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe, owe, owe, owe
You owe us something, baby
Oh, oh, oh",Nas,You Owe Me,Ginuwine

[Verse 1]
Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since ""... Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the crafts of the streets
But look at me now

[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

[Verse 2]
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man",Nas,You’re Da Man,

[Intro: Nas (Timbaland)]
(What?) Ever been in love? (C'mon)
Yeah.. are you ready? (uhh) For somethin real?
(Say what?) 'Cause it can't be fake
This ain't no game (C'mon)
You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)
'Cause it's real out here (uh-huh)
So make up your mind, 'cause I ain't got no time
Y'know? (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Verse 2: Nas]
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his keys
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

[Interlude: Aaliyah and Nas]
Call you on a Monday
I'll call you back baby
Call you on a Tuesday
My cell is off baby
Call you on a Wednesday
I'm out of town baby
You won't be back 'til Thursday
I'll page you back baby
Call you on a Monday
I'll call you back baby
Call you on a Tuesday
My cell is off baby
Call you on a Wednesday
I'm out of town baby
You won't be back 'til Thursday
I'll page you back baby

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
Thinking of me, you getting the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas, not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg, everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open
But -- you just my close friend
Get it baby

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Bridge: Nas (Aaliyah)]
The God, the God, the God, Nasir (you won't see me tonight)
The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (you won't see me tomorrow)
Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight)
(And you'll be so full of sorrow)
Uhh uhh (you'll go tell all your friends)
Tell your friends (how you called and I followed)
How you followed me (but you won't see me tonight)
Not tonight baby (no, you won't see me tomorrow)
C'mon, c'mon c'mon

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, ""Free my nigga!""
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 2: Nas]
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana
Or been shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the Gods
Moët spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shell toes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids, of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 3: Nas]
Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive
550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch
Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'ma die one day
They gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas
Only OGs, certified who kill niggas
When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga
Chill mode, spill more Spades
Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

[Chorus: Victoria Monét (Nas)]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
Man, what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
(Y'all wouldn't understand, huh)
No matter how you try you never can
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Outro: Nas]
True B nigga, yeah, uhh
For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B, what up, yeah
The whole city, I see you
To my man Big Slate in the Fed joint
My man Spunk, free my niggas
All my niggas, yeah

And Baltum, I see you",Nas,You Wouldn’t Understand,Victoria Monét

(I want y'all to blast on these niggas, man)
Zo-zo-zo zone out

[Verse 1: Jungle]
Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, forehead yawning
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild out there sold crack
Bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes

[Verse 2: Wiz]
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hoes
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin'
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My Uzi weighs a ton, your son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
The peeps be like one (one)
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son

[Verse 3: Nas]
G-O-D S-O-N
I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen
With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said
For me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's dead, who made this style, Solo or X
Are you UTFO's Doctor or Moe Dee
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryin' to show niggas ya rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga inchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway

[Verse 4: Jungle]
Yo, this is for them high school drop outs
Niggas who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back
Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have a bike on a bench
Now I got the Jeep on this trip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip

[Verse 5: Wiz]
Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quickly knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm all about
To all my real niggas
