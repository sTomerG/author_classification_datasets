"[Chorus: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, now

[Verse 1: Nas, Damian Marley]
The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaking, the sleeping giant, science, art is your creation
I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praise bridges that carried us over
The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us, do you hear me now?

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, now
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today?

[Verse 2: Nas]
Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after, the makeshift youth
The slave ship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
America's first immigrants
The kings, sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers
Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Now can we all pray? Each in his own way
Teaching and learning, we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed, we'll have some warm bread
Shelter from the storm dread and we can work it out
Mother nature feeds all in famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways, not to share us out
What's a tree without root? Lion without tooth?
A lie without truth? You hear me out!

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, Lord
Africa must wake up the sleeping sons of Jacob
What tomorrow may bring. may some more love come
Yesterday we were kings, I tell ya young bloods
The world is yours today...

We want to thank y'all, everybody out there
This is Nas, Damian Marley
Distant Relatives
We're all distant relatives
No matter where you from, where you live
How near or far
Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel
We're all fam, we're all distant relatives
So that's why we came together
One of the reasons why myself and Damian came together
'Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa
That's right, you too
And you
The whole world!
We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place
So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
I say! Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, now
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? Who are we today?

Now greetings to the world
The accumulative intelligence of Mankind is what makes us special amongst all other species
Everything is built upon the foundation before it
Huh
Boom

These ancient thoughts
This ancient look
These ancient hearts
This ancient soul
These ancient songs
These ancient people

[Junior Reid]
Like the Earth, and the sky
And the sea, and the birds
And the trees, and the songs
With melody

Like a mountain, like a valley
Like the river, like the lake
Like the earth, when it quake
It's anciency

[Verse 1: Nas]
This is rock and roll meets Aristotle
I fly those G5's through the skies to Cabo
Martial arts more ancient than Tae Bo
Swordsman, more ancient than Zorro
Ancient like the pharaohs or priests of Yoruba
Or Obeah, your phobia, you paro
Your path narrow like climbing Mountain Kilimanjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before Columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camo-
Flage, chief before sarge, or lieutenant
Village elders before the Senate
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st Amendment
In the beginning, the drum was the text sendin
There was moons before months, and time before minutes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
From love, on to language, on to hieroglyphics
Di invention of the wheel, on to mathematics
Di almanac, di calendar, on to geographics
Herbal medicine, to antibiotics
Ginseng to horse tonic
Water pump, water pumpee on to hydraulics
Moonlight, candle light, on to electronics
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college
Ayyy
All of these ancient thoughts

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Junior Reid]
Man ah buss di earth, man ah buss di sky
Junior Gong and Junior Reid we meditation it so high
Man ah trod de gravel, it dutty and it dry
Oh oi, dem nuh see nuh wings, but man ah fly
Babylon fi splurt, dem nuh know what life is worth
Oh Oi, tell dem stop polluting Mother Earth
Man ah mek ah trod, mi robe, mi sandals and mi rod
Dem shoulda know, ancient man, yes man ah God

[Verse 1: Damian Marley & Nas]
As we enter
Come now, we take you on the biggest adventure
Must be dementia, that you ever thought
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?
Q.B., Jamrock the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you wanna
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois, and I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari Gani, Mzuri Sana
Switch up the language, I move through Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas like two Obamas unfold the drama

[Hook: Nas]
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

[Verse 2: Damian Marley Nas]
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of your voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent
That's how you end up in a hit list In a bad man business
No evidence, crime scene, fingerprint-less
Flow effortless, casual like the weekends
No pressure when we're comfy and decent
We set this off beasting, hunting season
And, frankly speaking

[Hook: Nas]
Word is out, hysteria, you heard about

And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings

That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings

[Verse 1: Nas]
'Cause yo this year, can't wait till he gets here
7/21/09 my first son will shine
And it's amazing, I'm about to be raising
Another made man and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him just 'cause we're building a nation
Like Bob did with Damian, the world will embrace him
Girls will chase him, foresee they will not break him
And when I'm not around you look for God and thank him

[Hook 2 - JR GONG]
And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings

And there'll be no need for tissues
Cause there'll be no further issues
If you've got someone who miss you
Man count your blessings

And I've got love and assurance
And I've got new heath insurance

You're wishing you were sitting in the top position
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes, you never hurting
You knew that you was destined for greatness for certain
But see the over zealous, they be thirsting, caught up in emotion
You're keeping your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth, Wind, keep you in a zone writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose

[Hook 3 - JR GONG]
We've got pre-school and day care
We've got pension and well-fare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings

I've got joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings

I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through his door
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
So I count your blessings

[VERSE 3 - NAS]
I think you're looking too hard for it
Want the double R
Under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
And count your blessing
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means
To reach the level I'm on
You should know that there's only one Nas

But count your blessing

This Spear, eh
Enforcing all the laws

[Verse 1: Nas]
The Master and the Masses
One has power
The other one lacks it
Guns are power
Controlled by assets
Owned by financial forecasters
Who are the Masters?
They are the Gangsters
They are the bankers
The ones who tax us
The Masses
They are us
The sheep, the people
Divided in classes
I go off like a Shi'ite bomb
And All ya'll see I'm on my
War paint on my face, shit
My nine millimeter on my waist
I'm a problem
Shoot up your place shit
Let a few go
Then I get low
Blazing Haze again
The Masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs
The Elitists Groups
The Masses
They pray to Jesus
Saying he will see us through
The Masters are the aristocratic

Ask if the Most High

When the fifth squeeze

Scares you to the point
Where you miss sleep
With that said
This lead with this Ruger
And that shooter
Sub-machine gun
Ratta tat through you
Copper tops, hollow points
Will do ya something bad
Our future
Is Mislead
Three strikes
There's no school
When a teacher strikes

This monopoly
Get no job
Just own your property

Must survive any how you have to

But I have no fear
When I hold This Spear

Make some boy know me nah smile
Cause this spear nah beg friends

In a contact lense
Man a run from police
And a run down wealth
And dollars and nah make sense

So
Rise up to my defense
Hollow pointed is my preference
Should have been deterred
Don't know what you heard
Get referred
By the wrong reference
When this spear start dispense
It a fly and a tear through fence
Dismember your members
And all of your limbs
Body bust in enough segments
Well
Man a run drugs
Man a run risk
Man all a run out a time and ends
Man a run up and down
And a run fi dem life
And a run down this month rent
Nutin' nah go a yard
And food the a road
Then man have to go touch pavement
Despair was a tool
That was used to enslave man
And make manservant
Escape from Despair and Desperation
Becomes more urgent
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul
With spiritual detergent
A distant army
A distant relative
Controlling the circumference
And any man move with no permission
They're feeling the circumstance of

And the years them carry on and I miss you even more

When nothing never did a gwan you still have on somethin' new

Only talking with winners, a loser or two got my number
Still they think they real but they just really awfully bitter
Salty niggas hate the smarter ones, these are the doubters
Who sour 'bout my run, I barely made it out the slums
My value high 'cause I do more than rap about a gun
I made money for niggas, y'all never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires see that's ill 'cause look at statistics
Real millionaires and I ain't talking ghetto riches, thorough business
You mistreating niggas, heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G and if you was I don't recall
Who would roll with y'all, bunch of fucking know it  alls who's dough is small
Look what's it come to our rapport's good no more
We was good before till I saw what type a dude you took me for
We had a chance to take paper down, what I took was more
Because of hatred, opportunity wasted

Your car and clothes will fade

You real friends are in for all the wins and the losses
Fi Real! No question at all them ready fi rise the tallest
Take to the enemies all for one and one for all this

Real friends won't sell you out, no bargain pleading
For real, always looking out a meal
When outside a drought your real friend won't hide you out, no

May laughter from backstabbers turn to tears faster
I wish for you no snake shall slither past ya you have to
Keep your vision clear cause only a coward lives in fear
My surroundings got only real powerful niggas here
Real men we have a code of ethics, no question
No jealousies, no feminine tendencies, we expecting
No gossip, no phony logic, no counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense if your homey locked up
No keeping tabs on who was the last who looked out
Selfishness that's a character flaw, no holding out
Yo what happened to the honor, you're dealing withsensitive Primadonna drama
Teflon love for my dudes who solid

Two steps away from death

Coffin holders
Or I'm
Sitting with goons in the visiting rooms
Flip it I could have been you
Behind state walls biddin'

That Zion is surreal
And in my songs
Do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb
That's under these chrome wheels
My homies is the only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers
Have become more weird
As if they were superior
And fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature
I hold mirrors up
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective
I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition
Getting high with my brethren
Then I ask him why is Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons and suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom

Back to the future

If these are the last days
And 100-foot waves come crashing down

If satellites is causing earthquakes

Me gravitate toward the aura
And all the mannerism
The sending out of orders
And man start moving busy
The locking of the corners?
The streets and all the buildings
Mi love you like a father
Mi ready and mi willing
Anything what you a talk
Is law in my dominion
And mi have similar thoughts
I share the same opinions
Mi have it say you smart
With mi best interest at heart
I'm following your path
Yow mine whe you a walk

[VERSE 3 - Nas]
They appeal to the conscious
The Paramount
The Caesar, the monsters
The grandiose, the martyrs
The hell on earth pompous
Ellsworth Bumpy Johnsons
The Harlemites the Garveyites
Black as the credit card we swipe
Poppin' Dom tonight
For all of mine
I can see myself back at the Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium
Shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those
Place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems
That were left behind
By holy men
Infectious
Charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexists
Resistance against oppression
Progressive thinking
Ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored
Only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon
The contradiction
The cross the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinning
On Esau's back inscription
That it was written
That nothing is coincidence'n
They took our leaders and they lynched them

[Hook 4 - Stephen Marley]
This one's for all the leaders

"[Chorus: Joss Stone]
My generation will make a change (ooh, make a change)
This generation will make a change (yes we will, yes we will)
My generation will make a change (do you hear me now?)
This generation will make a change
(We 'bout to make a change, oooh)

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Now me love fi see the schoolers them a graduate
A study hard, and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with them diploma, and them bound fi great
Because them nah pick up no 'matic, and a perpetrate
And then I love the energies, what them a generate
My generation it so special, it will make a change
Because the elders sew the seed, and it a germinate
So anytime them see the progress them a celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a we a star the show, like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through, is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true, without apology
The mission have fi carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily

[Chorus: Joss Stone]
My generation will make a change
(Will make a change, will make a change, yeah)
This generation will make a change
(This generation, yeah)
My generation will make a change
(Will make a change, will make a change, I swear we will)
This generation will make a change
(I swear it now, yeah, hey!)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can you blame my generation? Subjected gentrification
Depicting their frustrations, over ill instrumentation
Because music is the way to convey to you what I’m facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation
Now if you can’t relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
What's up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values, education is real power
I reach them like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow
Add some bravado, get wealthy like Wells Fargo
It's truth, that I am you, and I am proof
Surviving through, we do what we gotta do
Yo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
'Cause there’s a mission we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds

[Chorus: Joss Stone]
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
(My generation, this generation, yeah)
My generation will make a change
(Will make a change, will make a change, yeah)
This generation will make a change
(This generation now, hey!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
If you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun
Been a long time coming, I know change gone come
Man I got to keep it moving to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son
But they thinking that my generation gotta die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don’t worry 'bout it; just be about it
Got a message from God: Heaven too crowded
But I say: Hey young world, you never looked better
And I heard change start with the man in the mirror, uh
This generation, I’ma represent
A generation led by a black president
Now hows that for change? Who knew that can change?
I don’t even look at the flag the same, heck
Uh, so when you finish reading Revelations
Thank God for my generation

[Chorus: Joss Stone]
My generation will make a change (yes)
This generation will make a change (yeah)
My generation will make a change (for good, for better)
This generation will make a change (yeah)",Damian Marley & Nas,My Generations,"Lil Wayne, Joss Stone"

Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye

[Interlude: Nas]
Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord

[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?

[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless.... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn

[Outro: Nas]
This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali, Patience, yeah",Damian Marley & Nas,Patience (Sabali),
"[Intro: Nas]
All I do is stay focused
Looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up
I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man
Let's go

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Play a star and you know your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right
And know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail
And the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Outrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus
My God's tougher than Zeus

[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

[Verse 2: Nas]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali, for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
Cause in life, you cannot press rewind
Get it right, you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skin, the dark won't take my soul
Survive spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end

[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and tread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better, must be a go getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Yuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever
The land and the treasure, work for whatever
Jah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are
We never let we don't know here which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca
Don't stop for a second
Everyone reckon, it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

[Chorus: Damian Marley & (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you


[Verse 4: Nas]
I'm a street lifer
Always harrassed by the cee cyphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerged from the street life
This for the homies who relate
Know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon
If that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater
I speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman
How in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy
When I pay child support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, But only ho's want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say their man corny
So I'm, stuck with a married woman
So fine, cheatin while they husband
Rushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if
This is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas seem to always end up
With some hard times, hope not
If a pimp slippin and a ho plot
Ain't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid
And it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin
With the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah",Damian Marley & Nas,Strong Will Continue,

We was once happiness-pursuers

Wilding, for a Phantom he can style in
Mask on his face, grabbing his Ruger
Saying nobody move or I'll shoot you
Man you're expiring, catch 25 and he does it like a man
He sides with black, white pride and Mexican
Survive the best he can, strap a shank to his thigh
Why do we all collide? Why do the young die?

TWO: Then me and my clan against the nation
THREE: Then me and my fam' against the clan
FOUR: Then me and my brother we no hesitation, uh
