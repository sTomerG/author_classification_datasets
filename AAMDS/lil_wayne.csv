And when we hit the club

"[Girl]
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You got one night only [x5]

[Lil Wayne]
And when they see me, they C-3 baby

She marks her calendar, reschedule every plan
She knows when I'm coming, she's more than a fan
She got my tour dates, she also got a man
But even homie gotta understand
She got (one night only [x2])
And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it
And when I go she'll miss it
But she'll never forget that (one night only [x2])
Next day another city, she's never coming with me
I'm nothing more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit together, she get her shit together
After my concert, she wanna get together
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special, then she remember
She got (one night only [x8])

[Lil Wayne]
But I can make you love me forever
Baby I can make you love me forever

Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later
Right now she with the greateast, I'm even homie's favorite
How could he even blame her, she doin him a favor
She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her
Take her for (one night only [x2])
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her pager
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor
(one night only [x2])
These niggas hate the game, but they can't block the layup
And she go home to him, he sicker than a patient
He waitin at the table, no breakfast at the table
He ask her where she been, she say stop trippin it was (one night only [x8])

[Lil Wayne]
But I can make you love me forever
I can make you love me forever, yeah

[Lil Wayne]
Them older bitches jealous, say she's a groupie whore
But every woman in this world was you before
See everybody wish to porn that superstar
But when it come true, how true you are
You got the (one night only [x2])
See, I can't be her man, and she can't be my girl
Oh, but we fuck like it's the end of the world
And we got (one night only [x2])
I got a wife, she knows, my wife ain't on the road
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes
Say anything goes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her

[Girl]
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You've got one night only [x4]

Baby, this dedicated to you
'Cause you make it look so good
So easy

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lil Wayne]
She said, ""I love you Tunechi,"" I said I love me too
She said, ""Can I come through Tunechi?""
Bitch, come through, we through
And I'ma go plum dumb in it and we all need fruit
She said, ""Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue""

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Because you make it look good, make it look easy

She make it look good, she make it look easy, yeah
She never come down, she never come easy, no
We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
We never cool down, we too hot for TV

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Cut all my exes off, higher than cholesterol
Tried to play professor and the bitch take a semester off
Wishing on a superstar, trippy life is too bizarre
Quickie in my roofless car, bust a nut and blew the horn
When she snort this Loius Vuitton and she keep the new ones on
Life in living color, she the one I spend them blue ones on
And it's right where you belong, girl, he make you Uber home
When he calls she threw the phone, I just cut the music on
Waiting for some Dominos, listenin' to some Commodores
Acting like some carnivores, after that we comatose
I ain't tryna bullshit my baby and she know me better
Told her, more money, more Prada, and the more the better

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lil Wayne]
She said, ""I love you Tunechi""
I said I love me too
She said, ""What you up to, Tunechi?""
I said, ""That's up to you""
She said, ""I don't want much Tunechi""
I said, ""And you'll need two""
She said, ""Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue""

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Because you make it look good, make it look easy

We never cool down, we too hot for TV, hold on

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Your ex, he so petty, fast food to her veggie
Gas you with unleaded, I had to 211, yeah
Now you're too hot for TV, but I tell you don't sweat it
Don't wax or trim them edges, I treat that bush like Reggie, yeah
But I don't smoke no Reggie, I give her Coke, no Pepsi
And her best friend a lesbian and I want more affection, yeah
Been fucking on the legend, the Michael Jackson, Jesse
Lil Tunechi, Elvis Presley, Hendrix, Future, past or present, yeah
I'm too hot for TV, too high for my exes, I'm rated triple x's
Too much drugs, sex, and weapons, yeah
And I'm too high to see me, diamonds shine in 3D
No Fugazi CZ, y'all boys really PG, damn

[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
I make it look good, I make it look easy
I get it from Weezy, been too hot for TV
She said I love you Twizzy, I said I love me too
Now bring that big ass over here and come do what we do
She pull up on the kid, she suck my dick and try to kiss it
I told her, ""Hold it"", call her friends
If they ain't fucking, can't get in
I fuck her on the kitchen counter, drop my kids off on that chin
I tell her face down, ass up, I wear it out like a new trend, oh shit
Lil Twist, drop a four, four, four
Fuckin' crack down on the Act
I'm sippin' slow, slow, slow, yeah
I'm a lil freak on my camera shit
I got that Hannah Montana, bitch
Pull out my dick, can you handle it?
Then

[Pre-Chorus 3: Lil Wayne]
She said, ""I love you, baby,"" I said I love me too
She said, ""Can I come through, baby?""
Bitch, come through, we through
I'ma go bananas in it, you know we all need fruit
She said, ""Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue""

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Because you make it look good, make it look easy, yeah
I never come down, I'm too hot to see me, hold on
Make it look good, make it look easy, yeah
I never cool down, I'm too hot for TV, hold on
She make it look good, yeah, she make it look easy, yeah
She never come down, she never come easy, no
We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
We never cool down

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Don't I make it look good?
Don't I make it look easy?
I could never come down
I could never come down, no
Don't she make it look good?
Then she never come easy, no
We could never cool down
Too hot for TV, yeah
That's some sick shit

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Skateboarding these days is going awesome. Umm, new tricks I've landed. Umm, y'all don't really know nothing about that shit. When I say ""y'all"", umm, I don't mean none of my fans, I don't mean people who don't skate, I don't mean people who do skate. It's just a lil, you know what I mean, it's a skate thing. You run into a skater, he, he or she, they'll run into ya and let you know what I mean. We always think that y'all don't know what the fuck we talking about. But uh, you see how I put myself in that ""we"", like I'm a real skater? It's all good though, shout out my skaters!
Umm, yeah, it's going well these days. I'm 'bout to drop a new part. I don't even know if you know what a part is. But I'm about to drop a new part and you'll see the tricks that I've learned. And uhh, when I learn some new ones, I'm not gonna tell you what they are because if I drop another part, then I already told you what tricks I learned. You gon' be waiting to see them shits. So, you know, now that go. You run into a skater there",Lil Wayne,2 Hot for TV,Lil Twist

I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Get your baby kidnapped and your baby-mother fucked
It's Tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove, I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level, you can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel
Watch me, bitch, watch me
Bitch, watch me, but they cannot-see me, like Hitler
It's the New Orleans nightmare
Money so old, it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby, yeah we right here
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah, when I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it

Cover up my face like a ninja
In this Alexander Wang scarf
I'ma drop a bag, they gon' pull up
And then they gon' let them things off
I ain't switchin' up my hairstyle
But my niggas let it bang off
Percocets and Addies, lookin' for a fuck I could give
All these hatin' bitches plottin', why they can't let me live?
Me and Weezy in LIV
When my album drop these bitches is gon' cry in the car
All your yes-men out here lyin', had you dyin' to spar
You was tryin' too hard

Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit

(I'm goin' back in…)
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

I use to wear two socks with my sneakers (hey)
Back when i was puttin all my rocks in my sneakers
Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers

We on some new shit you niggas can't find us
That's like lookin in the rough for a diamond
We might hook a nigga up on consignment
And for the rest his life we keep an eye on 'em
Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me
And on the humble the number still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to steep
Yea from a youngin to a g

"[Intro]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, oh me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker, yeah!

I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Post-Chorus]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (haha!)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said ""You's an ill nigga""
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

I, I see you with your palms in your pants (haha!)

And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 2]
Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble, better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (listen mayne)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Bridge]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands

Young desperado, straight out the grotto
I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga, but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga, I've been getting my share in like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... check my bio
I started high with two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts; cashews
But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away, like ""Later dudes""
Never get caught, baby, I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog; no Asian food
I wet up the party, so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't you forget.. I know ya, you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that... fall back

[Verse 2 - Fat Joe]
Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the binky, splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothing to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got your back, whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like BRRRRAT!
Nigga... them muhfuckas is broke like them levees
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga... how you want it huh coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you running naked like in Old School
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it, and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider homie, and you can find it on me
That 40 cal'll get your shirt picture ironed on it
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas wanting war but they runnin' from me... Crack!

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3 - Birdman]
I had 'em as lil' niggas, raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' with them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceiling, me and my young nigga chilling
I'm in the streets, hustling, getting money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga, got some new tools
Nigga got some more jewels, we was getting money
And ain't nothing ever changed, still doing the thang
Still getting money, still spending change
We hustling from Sunday to Sunday
And we grinding everyday like the money ain't coming
Nigga... yeah we riding woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thing
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs
Wish I woulda caught 'em Idda split they fuckin' wig

"[Verse 1: Jay Jones]
Mula! Yeah, look
I'ma tell you all this last time, don't get involved
Bullets start ripping through the walls
Hit ya baby mama and the house door
We making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward
Knock your ass out if you talk stupid
Got a big dick so I walk stupid
She got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty
Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mind in a daze, nowadays
I'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades
Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones

[Verse 2: Euro]
My enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee
I know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly
My closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses
Look, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers
Don't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em
My bad, I'm turning my back on 'em
I fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em
I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They got cameras here like Oprah's here
Since a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear
So I had to ""abracadabra,"" ""voila,"" just to make hope appear
Young!

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Told momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Mama, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two, and I'm out, voila!

Magic dust, yeah that's a rush
Got her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun
I'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio; we trap and go for casserole
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas
All in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila!

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened

You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!

You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm too real
Voila! Voila! OVO shorts, high socks

Time out, na-na, I got sauce, you dried out
I'm big boss, you big mouth, magic show, don't miss out, voila!

What haven't I done yet?
I haven't Bungee jumped, err, haven't been to Mount Everest, err, take that back, I've probably have been to Mount Everest. Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter 5",Lil Wayne,Abracadabra,"Euro, Jay Jones"

She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say ""I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid""
""You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit""
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say ""I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion""
I said, ""It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it
She say ""Who you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties""
I admit it, big booty, big titties; I admit it

[Chorusk: SNL]
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

[Bridge: SNL & Lil Wayne]
Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
Saw a flick of you boo'd up, boy, you never liked em skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well, I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin'
Boy, this here will keep you warm at night
Feed you good before you catch a flight
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type
Who you kiddin'?
I admit it, I admit it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
But I got these guns on me right now
I got these drugs on me right now
I got the Feds on me right now
I got two buyers, want it right now
She took her clothes off and I stopped
Looked at my watch, like ""Fuck it, why not?""
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, ""I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute""
I say, ""You ain’t never lying; thought I’d never say never, but I did it""
She said ""Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness""
""Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'""
She said, ""Who you kidding, boy? you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties""
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties; I admit it

They couldn't kill me holla if u feel me
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, day time soldier, night time rider
911 survivor, yeah I feel you
And who am I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up
They couldn't take da heat so they jumped
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above you
God, yeeup, now just look in your seat

Try to keep our head up, and not get fed up (nope)
But it seems like they won't let us live
Yea, and I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
This is why I scream fuck the world not the people (nope)
Yes, but in the belly of the beast
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs
Help! SOS, somebody save us
Ten dead inside, where our savior
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high
High, so high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
Yea, I holla five on four till they bury me man
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man

Take care of Jew Jew and his mom (please)
Take care of little Jah (please)
Take care all the kids (please)
'Cause through us they live
Yeah, lord please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing (nothing)
Clinton approved the money, and Bush did nothing (nothing)
So, Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just comin'
I'm feeling like what the hell is really goin' on
Planes into buildings, what's next King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song (but we do) Moment of silence for the people that's gone (Shhhhh)
To those restin' in peace, those dead and deceased, soon again we meet (soon)
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road, haa
I'll meet you at the crossroads
Lord, please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And i don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak

Rolling stocky, kinda brocky on the streets where niggas watch me
If you plotting I'mma prol'ly get to pop at your noggin
I'm a Hollygrove problem, like ""Follow me yeah
Come and be my death volunteer,""
That's why I'm here, I come to get that scratch
I done been to jail twice and tell them crackers I ain't never going back, huh?
Rode through the city with the metal on my back, huh?
Gave me a shot and I sent several of 'em back, huh?
Gave me some money, they won't ever get it back now
One million, two million, three million: I'm stacked now
No more crack now, it's in the back for now
Just in case she crack down
I never back down, shit bitch, I might react now
But, 4 million, 5 million, 6 million: I'm that now
Where you at clown? I'm high in the sky
You at ground, so set down you bitch you

[Hook]
Money on my mind, pistol on my side
I make a nigga hide that pride
I ain't got time for you bitches, I'm trying get these riches
Real niggas know that vision
I ain't time for you haters, I'm trying get this paper
Real ladies know that labor
I ain't got time for you snitches, I'm trying get them riches
Real niggas know that vision

[Verse 2]
You motherfuckers know what I'm out here doing
And you ain't gotta buy it, if you not into it
Dope block influenced, blue pale light, scream
I'm on that same ass block letting the bell ring
Looking for the boy, the one in the back
I could get your stomach out of your back
I could make you shit better, this better, than what them selling
They need drugs no penicillin and I'm the medicine man
Yes I am him, yup-yup
Hip-hip, hoo-ray, 20 hard came today
And two large was the pay, and the Coast Guard said it was okay
Bring them barge to the bay
And my bitch looks like a DeBarge so I call her bait
She put packs in her bra, and the keys in the case
If she ever try to skate with the cake, and relocate
I got her social and her birth date, bitch please

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I talk like a hustler, walk like a hustler
Stripper attitude, only money make me move
Dapper dan status, I'm the stunner part two
I got an image to uphold, and my image do, too
I'm off the scrimmage line like Emmitt 2-2
Why would the quarterback give it to you?
I gotta hundred sacks, and a hundred women; French twist
And we don't even talk, we just French kiss, I could never get pinched
I'm rocking like a big pimp
Momma only dated hustlers, so I could only commend them
And never roll with a dummy on your hip
Have the judge giving you a run-on sentence
Never that, I keep the gun on for that business
And when I'm not, I'm at business
See that's that, mad business, peep the simplistics
It's Cash Money, nigga, just live it

Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his momma to get him some nice threads
So at least he'll be a bitch ass nigaa dyin' in style
He didn't want to look up to me now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell em on these beats I'm a beast
Half-man, half-animal like King on Tekken
I'll wreck him, hell yeah, Young Money is what I'm reppin'
Respect 'em or I'll put you on that highway to heaven
Matter of fact, pussy, you'll get your own lane

Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you

We won't take a deal cause we got the paper (Nah)
That people hate it, we still nominated
Young Rich Niggas yeah we graduated

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Takeoff! Takeoff!
Amazing Amy

(Nah) she been patiently waiting
Waitin' for me to get famous (Waitin' for)
Want me to buy her Mercedes

I'm focused on the M&M's
You want Benjamin Franklins you gotta have patience
I pull up in the coupe and its disabled
I'm drinking on maple these bitches watching me on cable (Actavis)
Nigga's trynna copy but they can't be the creator
I'm a legend, feel like Will Smith, can you be my Jada?
And I'm in the Oakland, Audi looking like a Raider
When the Migos in your city we pack out your stadium
In the kitchen with the Dominican's I'm creating em'
Trappin and dabbin', pull up at your bando with Wayne & them!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She's so amazing
Lord I feel like Plies, that's my lil' baby

"[Intro: Lil Wayne & (DJ Raj Smoove)]
Raj Smoove (Yeah)
The greatest DJ in the world (Yeah)
Ooh boy (Yes!)
We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
I'mma call this one ""Real Rap""
Anybody you lost, put 'em on your heart
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for 'em
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin', but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin' on us
Government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga
But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin'
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin'
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera —
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Or my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my Grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully, but, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby
Amen

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit

And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick

Who that one that do that, boy?

And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers

And the Bible told us every girl was sour

Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""

They don't feel me but they fear me

Let her bang, let her bust, etcetera, etcetera
You niggas is scared of the, southern part of America

I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms
She sniffin' that King and she mix it with Kong
Her clit got a ring, and my dick got a horn
This is what I call a risk and reward
We cutting it close, give the ninja the sword
Fuck what they think, man these niggas don't know us
This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then it's the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
I'm on the front until combat is done
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon' take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Wipe the gun off with my towel
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killing, you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
You runnin' your mouth, seein' how quick you can chase it
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raisin'
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Death is related, happy we made it
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit

My favorite movie quote is ""You got 14 bricks in that bag right there?"" That's my favorite movie quote. That was Cam talking to, uh you know Mitch and all them, that was uh, damn I always forget the name of the movie and it's my fucking favorite quote but it ain't my favorite movie, but like that's my favorite movie quote. My favorite movie, if you wanted to know, if I ever said it, I never said it, it's Sixth Sense, so don't ask me why, I see dead people, you know what I mean, so I got the fuck away from them dead bitches",Lil Wayne,Back from the 80's,

But I'm a giant, like ""Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum""
Just bought a new crib inside Sodom
Got some money put away in case the hurricane come
I'm a fucking shame, huh? Yeah I know, yeah I know
I go out the country to get all my clothes and my hoes
I go out my way just to get my dro and my dough
'Cause I love it more than I love my hoes, yes I does
I got gasoline coming out my pores, I'm a torch
I got glasses like that white boy Scott Storch, and a Porsche
I got license for the scorch, snipers at your porch
Rifles by the forts and we shoot up courts
The judge just a bitch, the jury suck dick
I'm an Eastside Blood and I don't smoke that Crip
I smoke that Kush, first name Bubba
First name Young, last name Stunna
Carter in the office, take notes when I'm talking
Smooth as a cruise boat floats when I'm walking
I boast cause I'm balling, I'm supposed to be balling
When I'm on the phone with bitches, man, the money keep calling
You ain't satisfied 'til your son'll be calling
Telling you where to leave the money in the morning
OK, you want a zombie movie instead
That's when you walk in your house and everybody dead
Yeah, I could take a shit where I stand, where I stand
And watch you pussies piss in your pants
You ain't a man, you're a ho, I could kill him with the flow
And then play the guitar at the fucking funeral
Big guns so they drinking big shots
And my gang go Saddam Hussein and missile launch
The Korean call me Wayne Chang, now listen ma
I don't know karate, but after the brain, I'll kick you out
You niggas suck like Tony Romo, no homo
And I'm all about my money, I get paid for promo
Yeah, I'm the man in this bitch
They say money talks, well I'm the ventriloquist
And if I ever jump, I'll probably land in your bitch
Boy that ho colder than my hand and my wrist
Boy I'm more cooler than a fan and a mint
And when I'm done this track will need a couple bandages
I be with savages and I'm above average
I'm a crazy ass star like a fucking asterisk
You niggas can't see me, I'm on my Casper shit
Runnin' so much game, I'll fuck around and lap a bitch
The club like a grocery, I just bag a bitch
And you know I'm gonna score like Deion after picks
I'm rollin' on a pill, she get that morning after dick
And when my roll came down, guess what I did after it?
I pop-popped, and took some Patron shots
I pop-popped, and took some Grey Goose shots
I pop-popped, yeah
Young Money, bitch and if you niggas wanna do it

They can't touch you Tunechi, Poison Ivy, man
I roll up, I'm smoking like some hot tea, yeah
I woke up and couldn't believe I got sleep, damn
You woke up and then you try to live the dream
But before you check yourself, check my history
I ain't never been a stormchaser, or just a fly on the wallpaper
I ain't never been a tailgater, always been a bail-maker
If it heaven sent right now, she gon' give a nigga hell later
If you don't get the shit right now
You gon' love to hate the smell later
I tell her hold up, your pictures don't entice me
She told me pull up, and then she heard a light screech, yeah
I woke up with a white bitch under white sheets
She got a black heart, telling white lies through her white teeth
Black eyes from always tryna fight sleep
Ran into your wifey, she say, ""Tunechi, wife me""
Hello, I'm so spicy, I got her sweating like Keith
Though our time brief, she be on me like briefs

All hail the death in America
Your ex be hatin' like eczema

I poke him straight in his retina (Pssh)
Anyway baby, I'm feeling ya
Feel like I slipped and I fell in ya
But that nigga slipped and he fell for ya
Gotta be way more careful-er

They play too much and never won
He got you a room at the Sheraton
I can get you your own area
Helluva, helluva, helluva
Girl the way you be taking this D from me
You act like you spelling something
Man this D put a spell on her
I'm deadly as my cellular
My diamonds sing like Mahalia
You gotta make a name for yourself
But these niggas fake as an alias
I don't see no comparison, no barbarians
I am not a human being, and you a humanitarian
I ain't trying to get booked again
Don't fuck with no librarians
Fell asleep in her wet pussy
I woke up in that aquarium, hold up

Woke up to niggas lookin' like me, damn

My friendship with Mack Maine is far, far, far, far, far, far more than a friendship. That's my fuckin' brother. I've known Mack since the hood, Hollygrove. He had the biggest house in the hood, it was right on the corner. I'm not sure if the whole house was theirs but it was huge, and he had a big ol' basketball court on his backyard and everybody used to play ba-, ball in his backyard. And umm, since he lived on the corner, like, you can always go and chill and play basketball on his backyard and then, like, always be right there on the corner in case some shit pop off. So yeah, me and Mack been down since the hood. He went to a good school, I didn't go to a too good school but then we ended up goin' to the same school, the school is actually called Mack Maine, know what I mean, and then, umm, he got known for fuckin' over niggas freestylin'. You know I mean, you know, Mack is cold at ribbin', I don't know if y'all call that roastin' or what all that shit y'all call it, but uh, he cold at that, period. He could tear your ass up, make you cry, make you wan' kill him. That type of shit. He one of them nigga, you know what it is? Still be laughing overtime and actually have you laughing but still mad, that's one of them niggas. So yes, when you know how to do that don't Lord don't let you know how to rhyme and he knew how to rhyme, so he used to kill niggas on that shit so that's how we really jammed up with the music shit.

She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoeing, but she the only one worth knowing
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'ma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, ""Okay I'm your honor""
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass I just be like, ""Come sit your groceries on my counter""
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma

Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one

I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company

I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky; blurry, blurry vision

I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, ""What other line?""

And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch

I got me a naughtier bitch

With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

[Chorus]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)

Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite

I see big cheese, you niggas' blind mice

Still sticking to the script, like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running, the bullet holes didn’t
Uh, basically, I’m still a monster
'Til the fat lady sing, I come to kill a opera
Y'all too plain, I'm a helicopter
My words keep going, like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole, wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks, Niketown, bitch

And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', ""Where's this bastard's crack?!!""
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, ""Slut! Where's the yay, or I'mma pop one in your grill!""

Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga

If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt

And why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?

And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them Glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all

Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets

Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't asking them for nothing

I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes I'm still flossin'

Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in

I hope I'm fishing in the right pond
And I hope you catching on to every line — Who am I?

Heaven in my plans
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can
How do I live, whem I'm as deadly as I am?
I get props and every other extra credit that I can
Cause see, I respect the merit of a fan
No homo but please blow me to Japan
Okay I'm getting hotter I'mma need another fan
I keep going so here I go again
Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a standup guy
Your hands smoking me cause I got your hands high
I pop a bean and bang Ja Rule when I Cry
You only know me but God knows I try
No x-ray show my insides
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said what's up.. I said hi..
She like that's what's up.. like the sky..

And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide

Take no nights off but my days the same
And people change but fuck it nothing stays the same
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
Lock me up but you could never cave the blame
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames
No you can not stop my vibe, couple page a game
Dang, a game? Yep, well gimme some baby flames
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains
Lord save the rings, I am way too vain hehe
Listen to that Kanye again
I play the game like I made the games
You playing like your trying to get traded mane
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane
You boys acting like ladies mane
Crying like you bout to have babies mane
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'

There is death in the air, you might catch a contact
You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
But let's just say that is a thing of the past
But can you picture the scene after that?
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast
Oh but don't you judge me, judge the one in the mirror

Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up, keep my main bitch put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
Your thot need to get her look up, uh
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, uh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, uh
That ain't sauce, that's puddin', uh
Tunechi across her bosom, damn
Shootin' up the jurors, damn
Don't name my pistol, I named the trigger
Benjamin Button, push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies gon' pull up in hoodies
And come take a look-see, better play hooky
I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitch's friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch givin' me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, JC Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winnin', win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to bidness, and we laugh at sentencin'
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artists or starvin' artists
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeers
Now your good luck lookin' like you crackin' mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile?
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
Throwin' pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And her man is simple so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec', I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, goin' animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug's Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walk around my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talkin' out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo ya
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And runnin' wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it, we put out the movie
Win awards, she got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostitutin'
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Gettin' the mula by the minuto

Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lolapaloozo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony, or opera, two-door
Hittin' some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to ju-co
I had to ask 'em, what's four plus two though? Rrr!

She took thirty minutes play me like a some kinda coward
Now hopped up in my car and started talkin bout her doctor
She said she started ridin it in her babys fathers Honda
She wish that he would trade it in and cop a brand new Mazda
I'm drivin to the label to the back and put the top up
I roll down all the windows put the car in function ""watch the""
I tried to touch her thigh she moved my hand and said ah ah bro

She say ""oo"" it would be so nice and usually she would do it
But lately she been spooked her boo just come from institution
I say that's cool cuz I don't really wanna have to shoot him
I gave the braud the pager number and said that she should use it
As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six
She beeped and left a message that she come up with a solution
I scootin a run through straight to my house I won't be foolish
She had no bathin suit and then want me to see her booty

She asked me for a kiss ah

Raw papers full of peace, cups full of mayhem (Yeah)
We all wavy, I'm just sort of on a different wavelength (Yeah)
See they more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans (Woo)
Bein' the greatest ever is my destiny still (Okay)
Since a child I focused on my Kelly, Bey, and Michelle (Okay)
Sittin' back, getting head from a mademoiselle (Okay)
Tryin' to put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will (Amen)
Dedicated to you for the 6th time, killed it on the 5th one
Now they say I'm big time
While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega, my uncle had a pager (chirp!)
I knew this drug kingpin that tried to run for Mayor (skrrt!)
Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player
If she bad then I upgrade her, get her unlimited data (blrrp!)

Nigga bought a lot of art, and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Beat around a bush, right after we beat the court case
Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the motherfuckin' horse race
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her keep her mouth shut, if not, I got some Scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe, referring to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake, it make it do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown, light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got the right time, you ask him, he say, ""Time'll tell""
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think that I care
Some niggas got a iPhone, some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm watchin' out for myself

Oh you know, I got Curren$y's new album
And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that ""I Can't Feel My Face Shit"" they know that
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
I'm feelin' like a black Republican, naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office (Get out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Toccara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high, higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail or be a murder victim
Ay! Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

I feel like a black Republican, tote the MAC in the public and
Act so southern n' die for my brethren, money
Money, money, like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the end. I
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I feel like a black Republican, drug money comin' in
I'm a volcano filled with lava about to erupt again
I stay with the iron, don’t make me plug it in
Stay outta rich kids' business, don’t be buttin' in
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
Forget a tongue, she put a lung on it
My Listerine come out, she start guzzlin'
I’m above you dudes, I’m hoverin'
Juelz, why you duckin' them?, Duckin' who?
I’m in the hood like, “What it do?"", comfortable
And believe me, it's nothing to
Send my London boys to English muffin you
You poodles barkin' too much they bringin' muzzles through You ain't gully, you gullible
They need love, they need hugs
They need church, Jesus! Could it be 'cause
They them (Losers), and we us (Winners)
And we up, this is just a sample, yeah, a free drug
The shipment is in, we done re'd up
But, I don’t trust dudes, like a prenup
They cockroaches, they gotta be bugged
I’m ballin' for real, you gotta D up
I don’t hear you boys, you gotta speak up
What are you guys saying?
I have the chauffeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not raining

And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig

See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door

I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by La Costra Nostra said
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here

[Verse 3]
I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips

Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint

They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind

I'm rude and kind, my cars are computerized
I'm cruisin' by, smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Brrt, skrrt, shoot, then drive
Now, who survived? We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blonde, they Cuban fine
I bruise they spine, I leave and they snooze 'til nine
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe

Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the frontin'

Murder capital only key to survive is kill
If the elements don't murder you the riders will for real
And niggas know I go hard to the fullest
Get involved and I got em playing dodgeball with bullets
Yeah, I got the sawed-off fully
In the Sean John hoodie, get fucked, you play pussy
Ha, we hit 'em up while they lookin'
And them body shots hurt, but the head shots took him
Damn, and if the red dot spot 'em then the hollow head got 'em
Knock his top to his bottom jack
Yeah, you see we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom at the very bottom of the map
Lil Weezyana piranhas everywhere you at
You gotta wear ya extra condom and a extra gat
Your bitch can get it for actin' like a man
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like your man
I backwards hand your man on command
In front of niggas he cool with them boys on fan
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates
Ducking the animal keeper runnin' with my primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in five states
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in the drought I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest pa' sub par
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive 'em for they know not who they pushin' Lord
Father forgive me if I have to send em to you Lord
I'm just tryin' dodge the shots they send to the God
They ridin' up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive
Not even in a eye exam, they ain't lookin' for I
The A and the K will make your face crook to the side
Now when you smilin' everybody gotta look from the side
Cause when you wildin' you ain't lookin' you just lookin' high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato-ass nigga, you lemon merengue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me get the biscuit busta
What up, Gizzle? You my distant brother
Real shit, nigga, same father, different mother
I skip the frontin' and stick to keepin' it trill
You not know me for nothin' other I'm somethin' other
Than people you feel I'm deeper for real I'm deeper than skills
My speeches can kill, rest in peace

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah, you underdig, shawty? It's all about one thing nigga
If you bout money, nigga, come fuck with us
If you ain't bout no money, get the fuck from 'round us, nigga
And whatever you bout, we bout it
However you wanna get, we can give it to ya, nigga
All runners, bitch, you underdig? Put your prints in, nigga
Put your feet down and your nuts on the concrete and let's roll

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You sleep in the field for trying the dude
I'll bust ya head to the meat turn ya mind to food
Food for thought, think I ain't lyin' to you
I lie his body in grease, set fire to em
I tie his body in sheets put the tires to em
Make em feel the Escalade put his feet in the blades
Damn! I'm the heat in the blaze
And niggas keep they ways when I'm in the streets wit blay What!
My nigga hungry he'll eat the plate
And if I ask the homeboy'll eat ya face, yea!
And though he got me, you can ask I'm like a pool table
I keep the eight, my side pocket side ways
When I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days

Yeah nigga, I tell em, I'll tell em again shawty
If it ain't bout no money, get and fall the fuck from 'round me nigga

You play hard and I’m gravel like ground dawg

Don't confuse me wit' the law, naw
But just confuse me with my pa because I am the Birdman J.R

With the forty Cal Ripken nigga, rip a nigga
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack ya baby momma but I'll let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still
Cause the lil nigga still ride on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
The Sig peel bandanas like bananas
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana

Take 'em to church

[Verse 1]
Momma don't cry
I know papa gone away
Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
But
Don't worry cause your son’s still the one
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And nigga I ain't goin back
I'm kinda little but I figured I’d be bigger if I sold crack
So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me ""Youngin hold that""
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

I gotta turn his fitted cap to a halo
So get adapt to the case loads of crack
The yayo, the smack

And turn that ho into tomatoes or plants
And yeah I smoke back to back to back
Like I’m on two tracks but you ain't feeling that

People always tell me I'm heavy I say believe that
But I don't get all full off the feedback

And I'm stickin to my word like bees wax
He acts an asshole for these stacks
C Notes not B Flats, ya understand me
Few leaves left the sole tree standing
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too
I’m in too deep, my roots go deeper than the spot
Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
I probably shouldn’t speak like that
But it be like that
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back
I’m outta here
Let me see my hat
And I rock it so low I can’t see where I’m at

I know my worth, so when you pay me
Just know that I am not cheap (I am not cheap)
On the road to riches
Tappin' my horn, so watch for the beep (watch for the beep)
Rippin' this shit to pieces
No, I will not look out for the beat

Got on my feet and rose to the top
I'm the cleanup man with the mop
50 shots disfigured his top, yes (disfigured)
I come from the city of God (God)
I walk around in the city like God (God)
Made it out and still come back
Somebody, please tell me, what are the odds?
On this mic I am a wizard, but this is not Oz
Cold but hot, I can turn the summer to fall
I'm sicker than y'all
Don't talk to me unless you talkin' 'bout paper
I'm buyin' some acres, no time for a neighbor
I'm from New Orleans, yes, I am a gator
I’ll do you a favor, and not do you a favor
'Cause if I do you a favor
And you don't come back with that paper
I'ma have to lay hands on you
Like I'm givin' you prayer

I got my married hoes on single drugs
Got my fattest hoes gettin' finger fucked
And my trashiest hoes is clean as fuck
And my nastiest hoes is neat as fuck
Take your shoes off before you walk inside
Take your shoes off before you cross the line
I snoozed off on Father Time
Got my goons to go kidnap Daughter Time
Come to wet the party up, and whoever in it
Got one gun that shoot for seven minutes
I'm done shitting, niggas never spit it
I'm high class, niggas' elementary
Repetition, that's the definition
I'm a Hot Boy under air conditionin'
Shoot the gun with the left arm limpin'
George Jefferson in all seven minutes
Got a hot girl off television
With a very sticky unhairy kitty
In the right position, screamin' ""You're consistent""
I sit there and listen like we talkin' business
I don't need her out here filmin' niggas
I'd really rather have her steal from niggas
I really travel like a pilgrim, nigga

Break a promise in the promised land
Going zagga zow off of zagga xans
From the middleman to the Macho Man
I've been talkin' shit up in Diddy house
Went to Disneyland, talked to Mickey Mouse
Then I figured out how to figure out
What I was figurin' out, you figure it out
Got a trigger man with an extra hand
My bitches sleep by my bitch's house
So every party is a slumber party
Sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you runnin' round, I'ma run it up
You dumb it down, I ain't dumb enough
I hit the courtroom and stunk it up
High comin' down, plug comin' up
You gon' hold me down, you gon' hold me up
You don't know me, but you know what's up
And the coke was cut with some extra coke
Showed her more than love, she just shoulder-shrugged
She don't know it's love, it's not important love
As long as we can keep extortin' the plug
Just let him bleed and ignore the blood
Just let him be and ignore the buzz
Pour it up, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but it still bust
Bust good as fuck, every bullet struck
Like a hundred holes, got a hole-in-one
Safe full as fuck, money full of dust
And I'm pulling up in that ""What the fuck?""
That's a muscle car, got me lookin' buff
If you look enough, you a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids

All-white like an Altoid

Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a young money goon
Your girl like a motion picture, she gon’ be coming soon
I do her somethin' rude, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Millz, then drop her off to Tune
Couple screws lose, you don't want to play with him

Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornado's too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You hear me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code

Nic, I'm the chick, that go getta like Jeezy (Go-getter)
Fall back, cause I do this here
Step ya bars up or you're through this year
Yup it's only right that the whole block stare
Hopped out the air in the blue and white layer
I'm here, I'm with Long-Hair-Don't-Care
Steady starin at my ear, cause my ear on glare
Now it's not hard to find me, top behind me
You be Harry Potter, and I'll be Hermione
I be early, I'm the girl they
Call The One like on my first birthday
I'm in that Range Rov, rocking that Kangol
That pussy real good, it tastes like mango

Big light-green buds, is what I burn
Nicki, since I've been rappin', this what I've learned
All these other niggas pussy, like dry sperm (fuck 'em)
And I knock this shit out like Tom Hearns
If it ain't about money, me no concern
A paper chaser 'til my thigh burn
And never give a bitch what I've earned
Fuck I look like?
I'm lookin for a bitch that can fuck right, cook right
And if not; then, left foot, right
Foot, get to steppin, yeah bitch, walk light
And my hoes talk like ""Hsshswash"", and I just say ""Right.""
We don't fuss fight

Zero tolerance
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still fucking with that block shit
Wet your ass up, head to feet, 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter
Tell the gardener cut the grass
I hear 'em, but they talking under masks
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money honey pie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screaming ""Fuck the other side""
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds
I put your heart on it
And walk on it
The chalk's only for the art, homie
How they trace ya
After I erase ya?
Look around
We at war
And you still in preparation
I'm riding for them reparations

Better play it by ear
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here
And this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot
Out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boy some dipping sauce
I want the whole enchilada

Watch me drop 'em

"I remember then, back in December, it was winter like '89
Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat

And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow... no

Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds
So she can't eat

My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb

It made so much sense for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb

And that shit I hated
Like early 90's late 80's
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me
I'm a G

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little I tote my gun
Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
Cause niggas is crazy
And I'm a 80's baby
You should be proud of me
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like da 80's
And my temperature's raisin'
I'm at 100 I'm blazin'
Somebody shower me
Please, pretty please

You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, ""Baby"", she just calls me ""Baby""
She just screams out ""Baby!"" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me

Dollar, dollar bill y'all

I've been having these nightmares of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in a Audemars
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I don't cut the work, droptop on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penney
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope, tie a noose
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'm a God, mercy me, I'm higher than Mercury
Smokin' on that strong, full of that Hercules
Bartender, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Niggas pullin capers like they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause I don't know what niggas thinkin, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she in awe
And this here is my homeboy, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw

Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man, it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade away, some niggas hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya, baby, we just want your uncle
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer than Leppard
Somewhere out wherever, they find your body severed
You know they findin' niggas guilty like they finding treasure
But get your money on occasions, I get too wasted
It's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, ""Thank you for being so patient""
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder

Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby

[Verse 3: Boo]
On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins
I got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie
Wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping, my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a missing person

Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real ""Gangsta Gangsta"" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'mma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but

[Verse 2]
Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggas love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'

Shoot him up, shut him down, shut him up
Eat her out, dick her down, cuddle up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
Lick me up, lick me down, done enough

If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore

Cops pulled up, and they vomited

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you

Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down

Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

I had hope; you may say that it's wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face

The end of the world coming and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster, this ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust your head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'm a get death through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything paused, I proceeded
I'm a leader, me, the son of Jacida
Fuck the world, not the people, damn!",Lil Wayne,Dear Summer,
"[Verse 1]
The people asking me ''Wayne, what's crackalacking''? I can't kid
I ain't smelling out my ass, mama, I ain't shit
But you can't tell my mama that I ain't the shit
And if you talk about my mama bet I'm all in your shit
All of the things go to my mama cause she brought me in this
And ever since I never miss her, never called in sick
I go to work, I don't quit, mama taught me this
''You go berserk for that crib, baby boy, don't slip''
I'll murk you for them chips and make Frito Lay
I'm trying to come up on the fortress, split it 3-4-ways
Hey - Mama say ''don't let 'em see your page''
Don't let 'em copy you off your paper, let 'em see yo' ok
And you ain't gotta do nothing but be your age
But mama how can I? I will be so paid
She kept me with money, I keep her with money, she like
""Long as you investin' in something,"" I'm invested in her
I got my weight up

[Verse 2]
Pops passed, I had to get off my ass
Had to put it in little bags and get off my grass
Nigga coming at me sharp my ass
I'm just trying to play my part like Cass', smart like Taz
I used to carry off-white like cash
Now I tote handguns like bags
Ain't too much changed
Still pitch and give 'em a split or a change up
I never up and change, I just get my change up
I'm greasy with the game, Joe Casey gave me, I'm an animal
And niggas hate me like rabies
But niggas taste this and lick nuts like ladies
I get ape quick and hit up like I get
I deflate the game and insert my dick
That mean I fuck the game so fuck the game
I grind to the money, say fuck the game
Man, niggas wonder why I got out, I won the game
I'm a champion

[Verse 3]
And when I got paid I gave back what I owed
So don't be mad when you see me in the Maybach or the Rolls
Making haters taste crack when I'm attacking the roads
Sitting so far back with the seat I'm in the trunk with the coke
You know what's under the seat, I got the Combat 4
Gave a nigga one, bet he don't come back no more
Nope - it's Weezy F and the 'F' is for flow
I spit blood on a track, call me Dracula dough
I get it sacking, act like I came back from coke
Not guilty or Jesus, let rabbit go
Wow, that's my daddy if ya'll ain't know
And I love him with every second my hard day go
Buck - remember when the bullet caught lil' bro?
Who you think got that blood up off that flo'?
Who you think made that boy come off so cold?
How you think that young boy come off so old?
I miss you pops",Lil Wayne,Dec. 4 (Freestyle),
"[Intro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be
You tatted your face
Bugatti, new boo
You screamed, ""Suu whoop""
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
And see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans
Than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can
To keep it solid as a you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, ""Suu whoop,"" and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, you just part of this shit
I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp
And your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money
Like, ""Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?""
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit
For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet tangy
I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch
If I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit
Walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit
In the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, ""Suu whoop,"" and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit
I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit
Put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit
'Bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just tha Carter lil' bitch

Young veteran, soon to be OG
Plus I spit like a crackhead with no teeth
I hear you little niggas barking, want more beef
You like a nigga with no guns, you gets no peace
And when it comes to money my shit is obese
Like Della Reese, I need celery
More money, what the fuck these niggas telling me?
I'm young Lucifer, take em all to hell with me, yeah
Drop 'em off in a fire storm, YM riot squad, get our riot on
If he testify like Common, see the fire bomb
If you know what's best, mothafucka, get your quiet on

One man game, nigga, I'ma die alone
For now, I'm with your girl, getting my Rowdy Roddy Piper on

Willie the Kid, pull guns like a hamstring
No bull, I push Pro-Vs like Pantene
Blow like a trombone, funny niggas, tambourine
Players get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearers
And my niggas on paper, getting paper like ballplayers
No blood no foul, yeah, my heart cold as Moscow
We nap ya kin like a hot towel (Gangsta!)
All my hoes hostile, not me, never tell me ""not now""
Rap niggas, forty-cal. to your brow (Ugh, ugh)
Roof-remover, we leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a moist chair (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Seduce her, yeah, you rappers should be tired of lyin'
But I know it's hard like a tire iron
But yet it's complex, like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math, I'm crazy as a mesc' tab
I feed niggas like a mess hall
And yes, y'all, It's Willie, how I address y'all
Or like a stylist, nobody's fly as this
You crazy? I'm getting brain like a psychiatrist

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
They say powder makes you hyper, reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot, thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave, upside-down
Blood rushing to they head, they reacting off sound
As I stand on the mound, pitching for the crown
Uptown-bound, face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters, Proverbs, Leviticus
Old-ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip, soundin like some bitches
Hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick, it's ridiculous
The new school nigga, what you need to do is become a resident
Under conditions, get your ass up off your ass
And get your ass up on a mission, become some competition
Like Federer and Nadal, Young Money, nigga, we ball
Like Kobe or Chris Paul, forgiving a wack cracker
Still sipping Cristal, waving the lifeline
Since life's a bitch, y'all, raising up the skirts of Jezebels
For no cash, like, ""Bitch, gimme that ass""
Or pulling up to the lot like, ""Gimme that Jag'""
No, pulling up to the lot like, ""Gimme that Lam'""
They study me, yeah, they cram, like I'm a final exam
If I hit you in your back, tou'll need a spinal exam
I'm something like a rhino or ram, animal, beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia, yeast
YM militia, you niggas better retreat
Or be like this beat, R.I.P., deceased

'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em

And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, already, you better call every pallbear-ier in y'all area
The ball carrier gon' get popped, if I'm coming around the block The in-swing drive gets stopped, he gon' drop like a flop
On the court, I love sports, that's why I play my bitches
'Cause I got game, that's why you pay my bitches, yeah
Same hustle, new money
I'm just hip-hopping like two bunnies (Gangsta!)
Who run it? Bitch nigga, moi
That was French, nigga, not a kiss, nigga, nah
Ha, no homo, rappers get ate like four and four
They say I fucked so-and-so
And I be like ""So, so and so""
Nikes on they neck, they like, ""Let me breathe""
I'm sorry, but I can't, this is how we feed (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
This is why we hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to follow, this is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave (Gangsta!)
You know we tote steel, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves, now
Pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't, this is why we bes
This shit like pudding, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling me to the ground (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)

I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring

I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine

Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world
Tune, you down to go around the world again?

I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks with my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I

I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant ""My bad""
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still

I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I’m tippy toeing wit' your ho
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops

I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin' with models, rollin' off pills
I’m rollin' over
Whoever's not rollin' with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin' I wrote Wills
I’m chillin', for the moment
'Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open

Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin'
Niggas slippin' like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay chokin'
Off the straight potent
'Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
'Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
When you got nowhere to go
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Dump 'em by the boats
Fuck 'em, adios
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long""
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah

Mula, can I get a million
'Til the heads or tails
'Til I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin

And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for

Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court

The weed so loud bitches get ignored

I woke up on a mission, I got 2 women I ride with
One named Nina and that yapper my side bitch
We size niggas up so wisely choose who you side with
Got something on my side that pack a kick – that’s my sidekick
I’m about that paper, roll the dice and get paid

Can’t kill me, I was born dead
Crowned of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head

Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before

Bitch wet, bitch wet, fuck now

Yes, um, gloves, draws, socks, tees
All made by Ralph Lauren
No shades, just my eyeballs watching them
Tattoos on top of them
Igloos for watches and champagne for breakfast
And sports car for lunch and pussy for dinner
I eat rappers and call it pussy for dinner
Yea, ask the paparazzi, I'm in the Maserati
Ridin shotty, bad bitch, Clyde and Bonnie
I call her Kami, that short for kamikaze
She call me Daddy, and never short with Daddy money
It's Weezy Baby, shine like a brass monkey
I'm never broke, never have a cast on me
Always paid, always got cash on me
I gotta feed, the pockets in my pants hungry
I'mma Phantom hauler, a shooter, not a brawler
And your girlfriend's a determinded Carter caller
Control a bitch and let a nigga hold a bitch
I put her on the corner shit, I let her make a porno flick
She will play the role again, whenever she roll again
Pop a pill, then roll again, now we on the road again
Yea, I work her, work her, tell her be my slave

Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)

But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]

I was watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys. Talking about how young black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.

You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.

See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only..., I don't want to say only right, but shit... Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that.

Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah.

You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared, I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track, that's the good weed.

You know what, I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.

Another thing; let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.

Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.

Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um...

Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!

But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just, not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.

You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him.

Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero

Crème de la crème de la Créole
Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own

Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long

Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em - It's that ""Carter V"", let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang

I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas somewhere with me in these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch, you played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga, get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', my needle broke

Come to tell you all today about a lil’ problem I be having, oh man see its like…

When I’m down in the studio tryna make a track
My girl be at home all over my back
And every time I say that’s what I’m doing
She don’t think it’s what I’m doing
When its her that I’d rather be doing
But right now I’m in the studio making this track
My girl at home all over my back
She blowin’ up my phone
She tells me she’s alone
I say I won’t be long, let me finish this song
But right now I’m in the studio eating this track
My girl at home begging me to come back
Okay I’m coming home, and when I get home
Girl I’m gonna kill it like I’m killing this song
But right now I’m in the studio

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Man just record me
And even with a equals sign you couldn’t pause me
Haha
Yeah, this is the office
Come be my secretary baby this is the office
And my office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10
I’mma say it again
My office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 2 - T-Streets]
Man just record me
My girl at home all discombodied
Lady, but baby I’m just recording
And you gotta know I’d rather do this than party
Man, don’t get me started
You think I’m crazy, my bitch retarded
But that’s my bitch regardless
Yeah

[Verse 3 - Mack Maine]
Man, just record your boy
If I sound a lil’ pissed, disregard ya boy
My baby girl really acting like a baby sending text
Stressed, tryna make it hard for ya boy
I’m like shawty better use your toy
See a nigga never absent but I might be taughty
Lordy, Lordy, I likes to party
See I could be with two freaks about to have an orgy
Or I could be with Pamela, could be with Audrey
Instead I’m telling the engineer: “dude just record me”
And as soon as Angel records me
That’s more Gucci, more Prada, more Louie V
See every verse bring us closer to our dream house
Now we closer to the things that we dream ’bout

"[Intro: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Where's my coffee?
Good morning, Dr. Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugghh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ughhh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

[Verse 1]
Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix wherever your shell break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Flatline)

[Interlude: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Good afternoon, Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one. His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work, and he lacks respect for the game
(Uhhhh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

[Verse 2]
Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
(Flatline)

[Interlude: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Good evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day. But this one looks much better than the others. His respect is back up, concepts sound good, his style is showing strong signs of improvement. All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

[Verse 3]
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply ""What a night""
""Welcome back, Hip-Hop — I saved your life""

[Outro: Nurse]
He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one, Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good

He's good, we got him
We saved him, he's a go
He's good",Lil Wayne,Dr. Carter,

Thank God it was just a dream

We in another dimension (Yeah)
She say I'm the man of her dreams (Yeah)
So after I fuck her, I pinch her (Yeah)
She had the wettest of dreams (Yeah)
She gon' wake up in a swimsuit (Yeah)
They tryna sell me some dreams
Way too fuckin' expensive (Yeah)
I been sippin' all this lean, that's why my eyes are dreamy (Dreamy)
In my dream and I wake up, see all these fuckin' Weezys (Damn)
Mister Sandman, all your sand about to turn to cement (Damn)
California weed got me California dreamin' (Yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare

[Bridge]
I just wanna spend it all before I go to sleep (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Waking up on the islands, OD's and violence (Yeah, yeah) (Yeah, yeah)
Roses with no thorns

[Chorus]
I had a dream, (I had a dream) I was broke
No diamonds and no gold (No diamonds)
Most saddest story ever told, oh (Woah)

Thank God it was just a dream

Thank God it was just a dream
Thank God it was just a dream, yeah
Thank God it was just a dream
Thank God it was just a dream
Woke up and I screamed
Thank God it was just a dream

Roses with no thorns (Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I just woke up with some new tattoos (Yeah, yeah)
I just woke up next to ""Who is you and you and you?""
Got the groupie blue, woopty woo, hooty hoo

No mansion or no pool (Yeah, yeah)

Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That nigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I put my shooters on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, ""Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya""
She say, ""Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious""
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
""What happened to Wayne?""

[Verse 2]
I'm like, hold up, wait a second, y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ, throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot, then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
Tthat's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head, then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much, put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch, I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch!
Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down
Now she talking 'bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
Tthe way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
Tthat ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out ""Squad, take it outside""
I'm a taxpayer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped blackmail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say ""Yeah, nigga!"" My white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say ""Nevermind,"" bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense
Had a nine since I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

Smell it, like it, buy it, light it, hit it
Mix it with some molly now we gettin' scientific
Bought another house just to put more pots to piss in
Bitches got they hands out
I shake it like we just did business, this just business, wait
Oh my God, I'm drowning in her kidneys, she like

And the higher notes she hit it, I know I sound like a grizzly
And the cocaine look like crystals, that's that white girl, call her Chrissy
Hol' up, listen, see, you fuck it all up, you put that wall up
You feelin' yourself, but I can't hate, 'cause you got that soft touch

The craziest place I've ever seen a Lil Wayne tattoo on someone is... you ready? So, I'm 'bout to explain it, um... inside the lips of their pussy. Um, that's just the craziest place. So like, even when you see the pussy, she can show any man her pussy, he won't see it. She has to literally open her pussy up for you to see the name. Shout out- shout my homegirl, that's my homegirl, one time for her. I love you, girl. What's the craziest place I haven't seen a Lil Wayne tattoo is when people come up to me and say ""You know I got your name on me, but, like, I can't show you right now 'cause I'm in work,"" or, ""I can't show you right now 'cause,"" whatever.

A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain’t got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though
My niggas ain’t got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler ""Geronimo""
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I’m still down
True definition of loyal
My style timeless, my style vintage, Crown Royal
From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some
Yeah I’m ballin’ - And 1
All my niggas outside with me
All my niggas down the ride with me
And every freak that that I ever meet
Gotta fuck my girl if she slide with me
That’s word

Oh it’s way past midnight

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
We kick down the door, said it before
We did not come round to play games with you niggas
They say you nobody til somebody kills ya
Well I’m bout to make you a famous lil nigga
No game in this killer, murder he wrote
Can get life behind bars with these murderous quotes
The flow is like meth, it’s like crack, it’s like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I’m seeing right through you
I’m so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it’s Google, I’m brutal
I’ve been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I’ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don’t shine
Can’t rhyme in a cypher like this
I’ve been rockin with the best
They don’t put me on the list
I’m an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I’m finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin’ everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro

[Hook: Shanell]
Oh it’s way past midnight

Now she wanna get inside of me 66
She see my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man, she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick, me
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip, yup
And I don't lie I confess
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though
Gotta stay clean, plus mami in a Lex 4
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death
It's the Birdman Jr., sincerely yours

Have you hangin' 'round a bunch of yayo buyers, nope
And not a day go by us
We don't get higher than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone off, we ridin'
Where phones don't roam, they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleeping in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds we can stare at the morning, yeah
But I can't be there all morning
I'm a pimp baby, yeah I'm going, going, going, gone

These trees ain't papaya, mind ya
Gotta keep heat on your side, [?]
So I'm a get 3 more and cop you one
Wait, naw hun, cause you ain't exempt
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip, yeah

And you walk kinda mean, how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script, yeah
I said I stick to my grip
I stick to my money, that's life to me

Four sick, five sick, six sense, dead people

I received my masters in rapping you just a teachers pet
And I’m this seasons threat
Yeah I’m fucking mother nature
Flows so hard if you get up on the track I’ll make your own mother hate ya
Act like she don’t even know ya, act like she don’t even care
Ludacris turns rappers to ashes
Roll em up and put em in the air
It’s rap orientation and yes I’m glad to meet ya
I’ll bring the pain, ay Lil Wayne go get the anesthesia
For these none contenders for these rhyme offenders
Their time is not on my agenda bitch nigga

Watch the bullets chop off the head
And make 'em fall in the grass
One move they all die

Y'all better learn
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
Hold 'em fo' ransom, hear me smart boy

And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like ""Where that safe at, bitch?""

I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin

You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six

You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched
This that Dedication 6, you know every day we sick
Give me wet, a life, a gift, catch a body like the Lyft

But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me

That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me

[Chorus]
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

[Verse 3]
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""thay's my peoples""
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

[Chorus]
I know you can't be close to me nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know

Stop through my honey chrome right along the beach side
Ay, how can I answer at your sweet mind
Tell me 'bout your day

And she don't let another name out her lip, uh huh, gangsta

I will ne-e-ever leave you girl
Like R. Kelly said, while the R. Kelly played
Full time mother, you work hard everyday
I wake up beside you, thank the Lord everyday
Oh, beautiful woman, I look forward everyday
Just to see that childhood scar on your face, hah
I got a Tony Montana chick
If your girl get out of line, she a manner chick?
If my world get out of line, she program my shit
I know my shit do stink, but she can stand my shit
I got the flip-flop paint on her standard shift
Dot 6 Range Rover, I advance my bitch
How you gon' go get some pants like that
With an ass like that, you know I'm bad for that
But you ain't gotta answer that
Long as every time I call you answer back

Ride with a G and come join me on this adventure
Hop on the beat and put your ass on the 20 inches

I promise I'll leave straight from the stage to under you skirt
Got riders with me, but don't mind them, they only homies
They only gonna let you get on me, so get on me

Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like ""A Milli"" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit

I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch
The best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say ""BLAOW"" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go ""bada boom,"" one of them go ""bada bing""
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles

I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves, damn

I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, ""Oh my God""
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: ""Don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, ""Can you look this way? Can you look this way?""
Flash! I must be famous

Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah!)

I'm waking up I'm taking up the industries space and I'm wastin' 'em (Yea)
They can't look me in my face and I'm grillin' 'em (Bling)
How my smile worth a million (Ha)
Because diamons are forever
Pluck a diamond from the bezel

[Lil' Wayne]

That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me you know

[Interviewer]
So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?

[Lil' Wayne]
I mean, I would say the voice of the hood cause thats who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean, my family thats who I represent
My homies, my girl, my life you know

[Verse 2]
C'mon, bang this shit nigga pump my shit
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch

Feel me

[Lil' Wayne]
And see thats where everybody get me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, foreal

[Interviewer]
Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?

Put this dick back in your mouth please""
I don’t see nothing wrong with
Some mouth and lip service

Sorry for the wait
The confusion, the disturbance

Whippin' in the kitchen
In the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions
And I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin'
Talkin' bout the third ward

And the Judge was a jerkoff
Got a bad bitch

Let her drink too much
Now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla
Boy I'm cozy like a furball
Fuck the other side
Nigga we could have a turf war

Yeah the lights is bright, but I got a short fuse, don't snooze
Been handling the game so long my thumbs bruised
Your new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue

It's hot down here, take a walk with Satan, yeah
Come on mama, let the Carter make ya
Toss you like a fruit salad, strawberry-grape ya

Addicted to the game, like Jordan and Payton

Been running for too long, it's time to give me mine
Straight down your chimney, in your living room, it's I

If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?

When we had a black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes

Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'

I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate

Y'all ain't shit, but y'all piss-poor, and
Sittin' in the foreign like I'm on a Harley
Keep bloodsuckers away with the garlic
Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets

Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie

I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward",Lil Wayne,Fly Away,

So they ask me
""Young boy...
What you gonna do the second time around?
How you gon' come back?""
I tried told 'em:
""I come back like 32
I jump back like 33!""
Ugh!
Hit me!
That's nothing
This here's Tha Carter II, people
This is Tha Carter II, people

[Verse]
Hey! They call me... Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias!
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious, going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffin', I'm just pitchin', your honor
I ain't snitchin', your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter, open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a fo' in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryin' to hustle my dope
Tryin' to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryin' to tell you 'fore you jump that my Mac ain't broke
You ain't trying to see how far that black back lane go, no!
Call me Pac-Man, your ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh!
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up, tryin' to take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504 you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like ""Keep your dough"", he got ya ho
And the sun shines on the King and sets on the Prince
I met the Birdman, and I been shining ever since

I got the game
On ball and chain
I threw the key in the drain
I'm like a ki in a drought
I spent a G on these frames
But my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggas
Like a fuckin' psychic
Hearing through the grapevine
Niggas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift
Man you better be Peyton
Boy the heat's on
They making peace bonds
I'm in this bitch throwing up the ""17"" sign
Straight frowns, no daps
Strapped three times
A Tec-11, AK-47, one Beretta
Ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niggas come together
Heavy better, nigga
Super-soaker wet a nigga
Six feet under flowers
You ain't nothing but a petal, nigga
I'm just a little nigga
Trying to be a civil nigga
30 years old, shit
That'll be a given, nigga
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listening
But she ain't really tripping
'Cause the pots is pissed in
Them niggas trippin'
Until the shots whistlin'
Hear them bullets hissin'
Like a cobra at attention
I got a bitch, and quit calling women bitches
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true player, no quittin'
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin'
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
And since the future ain't promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in that heat 'til the motherfucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope
Let 'em tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless
Rats and roaches
Running 'cross the porch
In the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it
Automatics in motion
We banging for the bread

I got my loaf
I got my toast
Chaperone of the South
I got my coast

Them soft ass dudes just think tough
We shoot and put them shanks up
We tryin' live to summer and put them minks up
I'm sinked up in the coupe, the eyes chinked up
Pull up on a bitch at the light, that night linked up
Whole lotta shit in the life of a young boss

Yeah, I ignite and take off, now catch up
I'm the best doing it, c'mon niggas 'fess up
Nigga feel different he could chess up and guess what

"[Verse 1]
Uh, we had lunch
We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And said the next dick she take would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak
She had the lobster
I say, ""I want you on my team""
She say, ""I don't join rosters""
Oh, believe dat
And then the drinks came
And then the mood changed
And then her answer switched
She let her hair down
And lit a cancer stick
She saw it turn me off
And said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room
And I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

[Chorus]
Like, ""Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?""
She say, ""Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it""
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said, ""That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga""
And then she said, ""If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—""

[Verse 2]
We had dinner, we talked about the future
She said I could have chose any bitch, I would beg to differ
But beggars can't be choosers, yeah, hm
And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She say she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, ""Especially that nigga Wayne""
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, ""You know, girl stuff""
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up

[Chorus]
Like, ""What you think?"" (Ha-ha-ha)
""Should I do it?""
She say, ""Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it""
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said, ""That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga

And then she said, ""If you do, you better fuck him good

[Verse 3]
We had breakfast, yeah
We fucked all night long and shit
We fell asleep naked
So when we woke up, she wanted that morning dick (I gave it to her too, hm, yeah)
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night, and I should have stopped her
I say, ""Believe that""
And then my phone rang
She saw my girl name
And then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, ""I'm going home, Wayne""
I said, ""Lisa, chill""
And that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, ""I hate rappers""
And then her girl laughed and said, ""Bitch, what happened?""

[Chorus]
And she said, ""What you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck from 'Hi, how you doing""
And then her friend on the phone say, ""Girl, I was just trippin', I would have fucked that nigga

Front door, leggo
A Dedication!

[Verse]
Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop-bop, but if I was blind, all I hear is runnin'
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbin'
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it comin'
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speakin' hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth, and mug you
The pockets bustin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleedin' blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga, triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace, but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the streets, I gotta hit a hustle
Every day of the week I gotta get loaded-loaded, skip the bufferin'
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches sufferin' 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fuckin'
They can't hide their battle scars but they can hide their stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how their mouths are runnin'
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall, but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown, or nothing; I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin', we got babies smugglin' in their Huggies
Niggas jugglin' different kind of drugs, Feds strugglin'
Sippin' Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it head-buttin'
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard and shred somethin'
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin
Go 'head, dump 'em, redrum 'em
Goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond
Headhuntin', Good Will Huntin', still stuntin'
All or nothin', Warren G to Warren Buffett
Stormin', floodin', lightnin', thunderin'
Carter comin', like karma comin'
My bitch pussy's the warmest oven
Need morning lovin'
She foreign, Donald might bomb her country
Thick as fuck, no panties when she got on her onesie
Whoa
Time to get this paper though
You ape or ho?
Bitches in line to get this snake fo' sho'
We take the dough
If they don't pay the dough, and that's fo' sho'
We make 'em vegetables, and we don't even like vegetables
These niggas extra broke, we break a nigga down to decimals
We up in México to see the plug, and not electrical
High cholesterol, you niggas salty, I'm the pepper though
Your bitch ain't half a ho, she wanna be in my next episode
I'm a steppin' stone
And that .380, that's my chaperone
It blow like saxophone
And when the smoke clear I'ma stand alone
I'm from the terrordome
Yeah, that's New Orleans, home of methadone
Cops on megaphones
It's so much bad luck, ain't no leprechauns
I been called a stone, pocket full of stones
On the corner moving stones, Papa was a rolling stone
I'm so stoned, in this bitch, waitin' on Babylon
Bible on the dresser, next to the gun and Tylenol, silence off
Spike a bitch drink, like volleyball
Olive Oyl skinny bitches can't get in the ride at all
Not at all
I'm involved in a real private war, time to brawl
Niggas don't want Lil Tune to take these diamonds off
I'ma talk crazy to a deaf nigga, these niggas blind
I'ma still throw up my set, nigga, steel toe in your chest, nigga
""Hell no"" to a yes-nigga, ""Fuckin' right"" to a bad bitch
She can fuck around and get her ass licked
Still can't get her ass kissed
Black fist, middle finger to taxes, the police and their actions
I'm still pickin' out mansions
Still dickin' down such-and-such, still fuckin' with so-and-so
Still fuckin' my bitch's friends, never fuck my woadie ho
Still talkin' about Hollygrove, still talkin' about coke and dope
On the set in that OVO, on the jet in that OVO
I don't threaten, I go for broke, wanna step and go toe to toe?
No bullshit at this rodeo, and all my clips Pinocchio
Tunechi, bitch, for nothing, drops mic

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Well, I can't technically 'cause it's connected
But, but, you get the expression, Mula
Welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her",Lil Wayne,For Nothing,

Umm to help these multiple generations that look at me as the reason they started rapping or the reason why they rap and into music is ... uh ... it's unexplainable. There isn't a word for it. You can't describe the feeling. Um if there, you know what I mean, there's words that's probably close to it, and when I say close I mean light years away from it, words like amazing, awesome, that's probably the closest, and like I said, that's light years away from the feeling, you know what I mean. I can't explain it, it's crazy just to turn on the television, just to see my own children walk inside and be like, you know what I mean, singing something you know like what is you talking about right now, what are you singing, what are you listening to on that iPad, what are you watching? And they be like ""such and such"" and I be like, you know, what is that, and they be like, you know what I mean, ""he loves you Daddy, he loves you Daddy, he always shouting you out Daddy, he always..."" and that's when they put me on, you know what I mean.

Tunechi
No Ceilings 2, No Ceilings 2
Next to Lil Tunechi you are so minuscule
So pitiful
Dope in the spoon
'Bout to go grizzly bear, no Winnie Pooh
Tunechi
Gun under table
Hand on the Bible
My homies homicidal
You dead on arrival
I'm tatted up, I'm tribal
And I'm duckin' trial
I used to throw my money away, now I recycle
Shout out to the Vice Lords, and to Disciples
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles
We sendin' Scud missiles
Your bitch in love with us
We simply mud sippers
More cane than a cripple
Look I am nobody, 'cause nobody's perfect
Abracadabra, I make a ho out a virgin
I treat her like a servant
Thanks for your service
I'm cold like sherbet
Got it sewed up like a surgeon
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'
The jokes on them and we smirkin'
Man fuck them niggas, they hurtin'
She deep throat like a serpent
I stole out too many purses
Got too many bitches flirtin'
It's No Ceilings 2, curtains

[Hook: Mannie Fresh & (Lil Wayne)]
Tunechi in the building
(I'm in the building)
His house ain't got no ceiling
(Ain't got no ceiling)
These hoes, they catchin' feelings

We 'bout to make a billion
Stop that bitch

"[Hook - Lil Wayne]
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A two dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

[Verse 2 - Euro]
I heard 'em tell me ""Go get 'em, young""
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like ""That's prolly gon' bruise""
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, ""Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes""
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)

[Verse 3 - Kidd Kidd]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell em don't worry bout me I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If i fall it's gon be from too many drugs
You asking questions, bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the club",Lil Wayne,Fuckin’ Problem,"Euro, Kidd Kidd"

Look, look, look

[Verse 1]
A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin ride
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and Glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads they tryna get me stomped keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waistline
Duckin the law, cause I ain't tryna' do no Fed time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Ginae and keep Ms. Cita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world

Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world

Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The Feds said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And whole family deny me of what I do cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin' away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin' but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 3]
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'mma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all'a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

I go by Weezy The Don
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, freezin' the arm
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck are them killas with the money nigga
We be the squad. It's so serious like
It's like ain't nothin' but 10 hot shellys
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothin' sweet cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look up out the window, see the man and his dawgs
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your abdomen’s gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' with me get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

Tinted up Ferrari wagon, braggin'
Ohh, what's happenin'?

Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eats on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

It's too dark for ya's
I ain't got no love for ya's

Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it

Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that ho shit
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:

Wipe off your family randomly - U Understand?

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
This song right here is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans...we call him this:

Georgia (That's right) Georgia (Bush)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Now, this song is dedicated to the one with the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef with you-know-who
Fuck it, he just let em kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had our niggas sitting on top their roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and President (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some folk that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965: I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now it's (Georgia) Bush

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Now, I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the White House hating
Trying to wash us away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest
They saying that you gotta have paper if you tryna come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap
See we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses
The mayor say don't worry bout it
And the children have been scorned, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out
Yeah we like to thank all of y'all, but fuck President (Georgia) Bush
When you see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tig' cause he died in the storm
Fuck President (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still movin' then he holdin' it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tches
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yeah!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Money, money, money: get a dollar and a dick
Weezy Baby that crack, motherfucka, get a fix
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist (Yes)
Yep, I'm a motherfuckin' trip
I'm a trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
900 to a grand, get you 28 grams
If you talking bout bricks, I'm the interstate, man
And the women say ""damn"", them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And with no pen I'm sorta like a bomb ""Boom""
Young Tune, yeah that's what my people call me
50 thousand for the cross, tryna keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yeah
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yeah, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, Purple Heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game, no arguing
And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep your bitch ass lines inside the margin

Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin'

But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said ""fuck it"" - bought 2 houses in Miami
I can't wait to do Cribs; MTV, come on, get at me
Any rapper wan' get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half a hundred for a feature, wanna battle? I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of Miss Cita
Mom dukes, my Jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna be the boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Not a sim simma, 10 keys in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving: couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfuckin' ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price rising for a show and the flow

Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve

And if a nigga disrespect me, then he shall be buried there
That's my word, got a urge to hit a nigga and swerve
And them birds in the tree get shot down to my feet

[Verse 3]
Before I had my aim
I still had a pistol
Missing ya whole chest
Hitting ya whole temple
Like 95, 96 getting it in the rental
So short I had to sit on a pillow
Let the whole quaker sit on the griddle
Cook em up and shoot em out like missiles
Boot em up and call em out like bitches
They ain't nothing but bitches
They ain't fucking with this shit
They swinging and missing
My angle is different, they ain’t seeing me
Look into my music, that’s the window to my soul
See the g in me, long hair all black like Easy-E
Little nigga got smack like the DvD
Click-clack sound sweet to me
Pap-pap you look asleep to me (what you saying)
Click-clack sound sweet to me
Pap-pap you look sleep to me
Good night

"[Intro]
Drought 3, hear my chains... ha!
That mean I'm ballin, bitch... if ya didn't know
If you wasn't informed, or somethin' like that
This is Da Drought 3, and um... check this out

[Verse 1]
Yeah, imagine waking up out ya sleep to them pistols blastin
And if the witness is dead, there's no trial
If you didn't know then, ho, well, ya know now
And I don't mean basketball, when I say I don't know Yao
Money money money money: boost my morale
Play with my money money money: O.K. Corral
I like a bitch with a apple bottom, like Vokal
The top is at my fingertips, like I ain't got no nails
I got blood brothers bitch, I ain't got no pals
I make a girl get low, like I ain't got no L's
I'm a paper chasin' dog, check my toenails
And I never miss a game, no Shaq O'Neal
More like Brett Favre, just like Brett Favre
I been shot two times; just wipe that off
But I thank you for putting me right back, Lord
And to you, Father, I would give my life back for it
That knife that sword; that gun, that war
Make ya so-called soldiers just run like Gore
Yeah, Frank that is, from San Francis
And I got more banana clips then chimpanzees
Ten addresses and I dresses
Like I thinks I'm the muthafuckin' best there is
And I'm about to bubble and she catch that fizz
And I'm straight from Claiborne, nigga; just ask Liz
Check ya neck, there ain't a crook like this
From the city where the judge throw the book at kids
Burner in school, in my bookbag hid
Talk stupid at lunch and we havin' ya ribs
If you are not home, then we havin' ya kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send ya half of ya kid
Back to the board, an extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watchin' Martin, just laughin' and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high like every single day
We do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you've done to me?
I pop a beat and start rollin'
And then I smoke it like a muthafuckin' stogie
Peep how I wrote it, I was rappin to the
Ding-ding-ding-ding... fuck it

[Hook]
Get high, screw the world, and that's that
I need all my funds, yeah, all my money baby
Black diamonds and pearls, believe that
I made bling bling and my chest look like a mural
I'm nuts, just call me Squirrel

[Verse 2]
My fetish is the girls, but the women, not the girls
Act your age, not your shoe size, maybe we can do the twirl
I'll be the Prince of her Pearl-tongue, earring in her pearl-tongue
If she come, let her girl come, give her a pill, give her girl one
Party time, excellent, yup, Wayne's World
Campbell's soup on the wrist, just call me Earl
Lil' Marl, don't shoot em, ya heard?
I get high, my words slur, I start callin 'em Merle
Hey, Merle, light that firre
And I know this old, but I'm really ""Hot in Herre""
I went with the Phantom, my niggas coppin' the spurs
My hand's in the pot, I'd rather eat and stir

[Hook]
It's I against the world, and I'm strapped... yeah
I bring all my guns... shoot mothers, fathers, babies, damn!
Black hand guns to serve, we could see
But we are so blind to the signs they tryin' to lose the world
And we will walk right up with our guns, yup, hand n' hand, yeah
We'll march right after the drum, but I don't need no band

"[Verse 1]
The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like spazzes come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like anbesol
But he heard

[Verse 2]
I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
Hem gangstas doin time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist it because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tec's
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fitted
Be on the block until them souljas hit it
That's when he heard....

All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin qp's to ki's
Gangin in the cheese, them bricks is comin
No droughts I don't sit on nothin
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay em a visit
That's when ya heard....

Lack of coexistin', just don't seem to work with other bitches (No)

Little monkeys in my head
Goin' bananas in my head, shootin' cannons in my head

I know livin without ya is impossible (yea)
Gone... I know you gon live on (cry momma, ya momma)
Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya

[Verse 1]
Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standing on stage in front of thousands
Don't amount to me not havin my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright, God, shit, I'm still breathin
But losses hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it
Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy

Lord, will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin
But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin
I ain't hidin and duckin
I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin, we gon rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin and we losin'
We survive if nothin
They could never take the stride from strugglin
I gotta ride, and sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy
And go after that money
But uhh..

I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds
Now I gotta walk around
Brim down
Just tryin to find my way to the next day
Escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday
Let's pray
Ten fingers together
Can't bring 'em together
It's murda-murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got a umbrella and a Berretta

You say you love that woman, but that been my bitch
And if you kiss that woman, than you suck my dick

She said she eat her vegetables so she stay alive
So she slobbed on my knob

Wanna have a couple words better call a G
Man I seen your sports car but it's smaller B

The money, you got a lot, i can smell the dough

She been to New Orleans twice never been through the Grove
Now her pocketbook nice, and her dress coal
But her teeth pearly white and her lips was swole
She bad, have you seen her?

What's the beauty without the brain?

Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head

Right on the club, right in the club, shorty popped an x and gave me head right in the club
To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with her and she looking better than her
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to take the shit in the face
Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my ???
Yeah, I'm glad I found ya, can't wait to bring Wayne and Mack Maine around ya
Gave me head in the pool and I damn near drowned her

Before I'd kiss that hoe, I'd rather kiss a perahna

Or give a little brain and cough up a sun

Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Outro]
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?",Lil Wayne,God Bless Amerika,

How? You don't know how to prove it?

Stop hatin' on a nigga

It rains a lot in my city because my city's crying
Because my city's dying

Fear God, not them, steer my robin coupe
Through the streets of the Boot, and soo-woo!
And then I leak blood in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry, there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, now where New Orleans at?

Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak, and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be

And yeah we all went through our phases, we all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shavin'
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient, 'cause they say you are what you eat
I took the star out of starvation, bitch
I come from a Third World, started rappin' in the fourth grade
Started trappin' in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade
Dropped out, a nigga gettin' paid, this when Birdman had a fade
This when Hummers didn't come stretch, but Birdman had 'em made
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get a new cup

While I'm sittin' up in that big body, I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape, call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had kilos, I needed one ki I would've made copies
Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
I smoke 'bout a pound in like a week, and fuck the Weight Watchers
Got my self a brand new triple beam, just to weigh options
I stumbled upon a gold mine, I thank God that it ain't copper
Some niggas were late bloomers, but, boy, look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have séances
Look, you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through customs, 'cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'

Made a few stacks and drove a few carses

Above the law, but under the influence
Man, I was on the skateboard, kick push swagger
Got my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya

[Verse 1]
I know I ain't perfect
Got shit I need to work on, a nigga been workin'
I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless
I don't deserve ya, you don't deserve this
I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me they sorry, I said that make two of us
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral, goddamn

I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn

[Verse 2]
Who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Since it ain't me, just tell lil' homie he lucky, I'm lonely for nothing
I'm starin' at the phone and the button to call 'em to come in
I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus]
(Love me), you must hate me (Or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

Count my blessin's, this is what we pray for, everyone ain't able
Drop her heart, just like a hot potato, I'ma say though

Rub my back, ask how my day go

She say, ""They know"", say no mo'
'Cause she go low, bless my wo-wo

Once that coco start her mojo

So outta here, keep that shit over there
Where do we go from here
Come to the end of the road
Can't get the road repaired
I am on Mars with a bitch in her underwear
She take 'em off and then come back to Earth
In a hundred years, you niggas Gummy Bears
Rest in peace Rabbit
I got the Lamborghini doors up like some bunny ears (Ahh)
Bitch, best not jump in here
Bitch, best not run in here talkin' crazy
Get her walkin' papers
See these married niggas makin' it hard for players
But, see, the hardest players is too hard to play
I give her dick and a couple ultimatums
A cup of bumbu and a cup of coffee later
She do all the drugs, he do all the favors
So we fuck now and we argue later
Dick runnin' like an alternator
I don't separate 'em, I just alternate 'em
I got all the flavors, sit back enjoy the fruit of our labors
You gon' tan that applebottom, it's gon' be orange later
So I fucked the girl, wrote my number down
On the morning paper, set it on the table
Told her, ""I'll be back"" - Schwarzenegger

What's up
It's me
Yep, uhm
I've had plenty episodes with various women, but it's just this one I must tell you about...

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I met her in Victoria's
She was hotter than a crown victoria
On my block on a friday at 6:00 yep
I was on her yung joc
She made me lean and rock
I tried to tell her my name but laughed more so
Because she looked like tell me somethin I don't kno
So I told her my number and I got hers also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the store
So we hooked up that morning like around 4
And at that time I knew what she was down for
Yep
Soon as the door opened, war opened out
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin out of her fatigues, and she's never fatigued
And with her, whatever I say she believes
And my girl know I got a magic show up my sleeve
But with her, I can disappear when I need
And she say...

[Hook]
She don't even care about my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should I be
Shit
And she don't even wanna be my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me, with me


[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]

I met this bad bitch last month
Bona fide freak, we been kickin it for the past month
Or should I say I been hittin it for the past month
David blaine, magic stickin it for the last month
She got that coke bottle ill shape
Thicker than a McDonald's milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field like a bill's game
And she don't even like football, she just sits home
But she love it when I run it in her inzone
She love to role play and put them wigs on
Yeah, she be gettin her lil' kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is, but with him she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstand's how I wanna be
She said...

[Hook:]
She don't even care about her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with a g
And who is he to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should he be
Shit
And she don't want him to be her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with a g
And she gonna do her thang with a g, with a g

[Verse 2]
Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin' like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy

[Bridge 2]
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin', Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

[Verse 1]
Quit talking, I’ma hang you by your tongue, yeah
Any motormouth could get hung high
We don’t fuck with niggas, like fungi, we don’t even hear ya
Hollering bullshit, nigga, cut the diarrhea
(Get 'em!) Pistol lie inside of the arm rest, umm, yes
Lay a nigga down in his own mess, don’t mess
Player fuck around with the homeless, charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies
(Go!) Honest, you niggas is harmless
I’m calm as a Don is supposed to (be), Cosa Nostra
Don’t ever approach him, don’t get close to him
Shootouts ain’t nothing but rock-n-roll to him
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rosewood
‘Nother murder, ‘nother page out the notebook
It ain’t nothing, and don’t make it if you no good
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up

I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up (Gunshot)

(Y’all) Take them shoes off your teeth, stop runnin’ your mouth
No shoes, no feet, I’ll run in your mouth
I’ll come to your house, me and my goons
Loading up bangers, riding under the moon
Throwing up fingers, saying, “My side rule”
If a nigga disagree, that’s what my side prove
That Maybach Coupe a cock-eyed fool
And I’m in it like Bennett, ho, aren’t I cool
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and that heat’ll move
I got that Chiquita banana clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe, swallow the truth, belch reality
How does it taste? Powder your face, you a bitch nigga
All pussy, stop coming out your lips, nigga

Real talk, boy, chill with the talk, boy (yeah)
That Tommy gun’ll tear your neighborhood apart, boy (blatt!)
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
You start with the wrong boy, it end with a song, boy (oh)
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone (yeah)
Fuck the discussion, I ain’t into it, boy

Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up

If I live to be old, it's a miracle
Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got old school bitches and new school hoes
Female basketball players with cornrolls
And I don't like short-haired girls, no not really
If I do, she gotta look like the old Halle Berry
Or the broke Toni Braxton, the first Lil Kim
But I still take hood rats and work with them
Put yo ass in a jag and I drop ya quick
Give ya ass a lil game, if ya smirk ya in
I'm a pimp, not a simp, like ice in my drink
And I don't think twice or blink cause I'm focused
Rollin in the whitest mink like I'm polar
Bear, yea, let down my hair
Get jazzy on a bitch like Fred Astaire
Rose gold in her face get her red as glare
My Bentley plum, my Mercedes pear
I am lookin for a freak, mama take me there, yea

Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em

Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh

[Hook]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 1]
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it ""Milk""
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

[Hook]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say ""Let's make a film""
I be like ""Action,"" I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say ""Shut up""
I say ""My lips are sealed...""
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got ""superstar"" written all over my face
That’s why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don’t check the gate

[Hook]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say “Hallelujah!”
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

[Verse 3]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
""Lord please don’t let this car break down""
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said “If it ain’t ch-chopped and screwed, it ain’t music""
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that’s the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that’s a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don’t give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I’m secure

I just bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Got too much on my mind hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest my bitch was under the rest
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I double the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam, and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shaking your hand and you get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't none to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fucking, sucking me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas

[Hook 1]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun in ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'till we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press

[Verse 2]
I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, rolled my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just Regretting Regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Move with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on yo door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga
Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga
Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga (uh)

[Hook 2]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech (yeah)
Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet
Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress
And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net
Let's go

[Verse 3]
Anyone could get knocked off
Any bitch could get knocked up
Baby daddy get locked up
Sell everything, put the house up
Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut
Except two words and that's ""How much?""
If I do get out, we're skipping time
She said what about her mama
I paused
I said ""I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not""
And she start cryin' and said ""I'm not""
And I paused
I said ""It's probably what's best
Well, I'll be back when pigs fly
So they can follow on my jet""
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired
Like the road wet
Like it's no sweat
I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't getting no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arresting
And to far from certain protects
Oh, Police, read me my wrongs
Or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes
I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets
They bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock
And soon as I got home

[Hook 3]
I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC 11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11:00
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard

[Verse 4]
I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain clothes pigs and unmarking trappers
My bitch believe what I say
I told her ""Salt, what's pepper""
I'm cold as malts and metals
Sell stolen parts
Whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball
Don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail
That's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child
My favorite one was Farrah
Man

[Outro]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next
""Motherfucker, you next""

Forgot to tell you I fucked them bitches before I knew you
I guess they forgot too

You shouldn't call me from your girl's phone
Cause she ain't gonna delete my number
Press me when she know that you're gone

I used to love her, fuck it, I still do
Cause love never die, but it can kill you
I pray to Heaven's sky, that it never kill me
It can get you real weak, but fuck it I'm a little G
My baby girl thought I was fucking every little freak
But darling, I was raised by a woman, that ain't the real me
Still, she managed to to spill out a little me
Watched the doctors wipe the blood, from her little feet
And goddamn she resembles me
She's my forgiveness for every sin and penalty living in me
She should be living with me
But what am I to do when her mother disagree?
I do me, but...

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
I even took your hand, and walked down the aisle
It takes a strong man, to do that young and wild
Look at your wedding band, that's 17 thou
But still she took the stand, now I pay for my child
And there comes divorce, mama I had to file
And as sad as it sounds, mama, I'm happy now
And my other girl got a new baby daddy now
And retaliation hurts, she getting married now
And when I lay down to sleep, I feel like I have died, I can be carried out
And buried now
But hear me now, I am here and now
So appealing 'til I disappear, but still, it got me feelin' like...

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
I'm in my early 20s, now all the ladies dig me
They like that baby face, they like the Baby in me
That's why it's Weezy Baby, and please say the baby
You know that nigga baby, yeah, he done paid me crazy
I won a few Source awards, I haven't won an a Oscar
So I don't know how to act, like my sweet ain't sour
So I run to my mama
She let me smoke and fret about my drama, then give me power
I'm a go and use all my knowledge and get acknowledged
If the pro tools stop recording, I'm still ballin'
I know you probably don't care about where my heart is
But just to let you know, it's where yours is
But...

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for ""Fuck you""

[Bridge: T-Pain]
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever

How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart

Uh, I tell her I'm workin', I'm not with these hoes
Yeah, she say, ""You better be workin' and not with these hoes"" (Hush, hush)
I tell her what she wanna hear, not what she don't wanna know
She tell me be quiet and ride me slow, like they got bumps in the road (Hush, hush)
Look, what you don't know won't hurt your ass
Girl, 'cause if you knew better, you'd do better, yeah, whatever, shit (Hush, hush)
I tell ya ""I'm here"" when I'm there and ""I don't"" when I do
And you just want me to tell all of the bitches I care for, it's all about you

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I get that
So when I'm with them, I just hit that
I don't even kiss back, my white lies are pitch black
Believe that and I ain't proud of myself
I can't lie to myself
I said, ""Self, gather yourself""
And left her cryin' by herself, whoa

Huh, I tell her, ""Don't worry, it's not 'bout them hoes""
She just be hopin' whenever I'm worried, it's not  'bout them hoes (Hush, hush)
Huh, she act like my stories are not gettin' old
But I know she'd rather hear what I tell her, not what she not bein' told (Hush, hush)
Okay, I lied to you 'cause the truth hurts
And it hurts me too, I would cry with you but I gotta work, I gotta work (Hush, hush)
She say, ""You better be workin' and not with these hoes""
But I drive 'em so crazy like I got the wheel on the wide-open road

And I zig-zag
And when I'm with them, I just hit that
We don't even kickback
Chit chat, not chillax
Believe that
And I ain't proud of that shit
I can't lie about that shit
I say, ""Self, snap out this shit""
And left her crying 'bout that shit, woah

I know my vibe is tight, and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die on this song
See I be riding, just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind, like, ""You gotta be kidding""
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king

Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth

If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second

Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Yeah, sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed

And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons

Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air

Weezy baby boy, lazy boy, yea
I did my service in the Navy
Now I'm just a veteran, they forever pay me
Dig me like a shovel
Mama I'm a rebel
I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble
Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble
You say it's clever
I call it whateva",Lil Wayne,I Call It Whateva,
"[Verse 1]
Hardbody, motherfucker, got the heart of a killer
Young God in the building, 'bout to start a religion
Bout to call Bin Laden up and order some missiles
Bring 'em straight to your block and go to war with you bitches
If you hit the head then the rest fall in position
Shoot a nigga on his porch and make him fall in his kitchen
Copped a big-boy Porsche with all the specifics
And I keep that torch, baby, call me Olympics
Red, white, blue pill, flip my skills like gymnasts
And never give a bitch money, blood or kidneys
When the gun goes pow, I be at the finish
With my medal round my neck, autograph on my tennis
The land of the murder, dope, crack and syringes
Pull up on you in the coupe—how fat is your engine?
Never talk to those that sat on the benches
Boy, I was in the game on fourth and inches
These niggas want the business, I'ma give these boys the business
See you fuckin' wit the boy that tote toys before Christmas
Got all these hoes trippin', got all these hoes strippin'
And we ain't P$C but them bitches know we Tippin
I just bought a pint and ain't none of y'all sippin'
Make my friends buy they own, fuck, I'm tired of bein' friendly
Ain't gotta lie just to try to be wit me
Bitches up in heaven waitin' after they die to be with me
I'm crazy for bein' Wayne, or is Wayne just crazy?
I been around, I'm still around, like them Geico cavemen
Hairpin trigger, no I won't shave it
I spot hip hop in the ocean, I'm gonna save it
The South is so dirty, bitch, you can't bathe it
Hollygrove dog and I feel like matin'
Babygirl, your pussy lookin' so vacant
And it's fuck you and fuck Georgia Bush, not Macon
Fuck Waist Deep, I'm in over my head
But it's cool, I'ma make it, I'm Good like Meagan
Your girl wants me to come Ronald like Reagan
Your boyfriend is softer than the carton the eggs in
I don't fear nothin' but God and weddings
At the top of my paper like I'm startin' a heading
My homie Santana, yeah that's my ace
But you may know us as I Can't Feel My Face

[Interlude]
Yeah, Weezy, bitch!
Don't give a fuck about you at all
I'm paid, been that way for a long time
Looks like I'ma die like that
'Cause if I ain't, I'ma just die

[Verse 2]
See they don't know where I came from
But they know where I'm goin'
And I'ma tell you just how the top feels when I'm on
In the game I'm no cheetah, I'm a tiger, I'm a cougar
I'm a panther, I'm a Bengal, Ocho Cinco
I'm illie, shirt softer than Gillie
In a pair of Gucci flops, feelin' freer than Willie
When them niggas Left Eye, it got a little bit Chili
But I just let it burn like the end of the Philly

"[Intro]
Is the autotune on?
Hmhmm, good

[Verse]
Young Money, syrup in the big shot
Time to do the thang, that's word to your wrist watch
Shoot the Glock 'til it burn, 'til my wrist lock
Rims hella big, tires skinny like Chris Rock
Hold the gun sideways like O-Dog
Shoot a nigga in his face, knock his nose off
Make the girls say my name like a roll call
Pain killers got a nigga 'bout to doze off
Big shit, nigga, talk big shit, nigga
Big bread, bread like a picnic, nigga
Shake the whole game like the hit-stick, nigga
Money spread like germs, get sick, nigga
Yeah, and fuck them other niggas
1-900-Who want it? I deliver
Concrete shoes won't help in the river
I don't care if you was Michael Phelps my nigga
I'm higher than the motherfucking Alps my nigga
I'm flyer than the motherfucking stealth my nigga
Young Money shit, top-shelf my nigga
We the motherfuckers like MILF my nigga
Ahem, flow like syringes
Yeah I'm in my mode, got a code like Da Vinci's
I was in the trenches, now I'm in the Trump
And everybody watch your back when you're in the front
You ain't never safe, stop playing with a gangsta
Bring it to his face and he ran like a flanker
Bend the girl over, put her hands on her ankles
I'm all over this Ice Cream beat like sprinkles
""Why, thank you!"" If you's a hater
I'm eating, you's a waiter
Pistol on my hip, Tomb Raider
Holla at your guala, summa laude
Young Tune, nigga, typhoon, nigga
And if you think it's sweet, buy a room, nigga
Damu nigga, I'm on my gang shit
She give me good brain like she studied at Cambridge
Lighting up a motherfucking blunt
Stupid fruity swag like a motherfucking Runt
And I be with my dog like I motherfucking hunt
And every day of the week it's the first of the month
Audemars Piguet with the diamonds in the face
Can't tell the time cause the diamonds in the face
We can get it popping like a semi automatic
And if you got beef I'll put the biscuit on a patty
Rockstar tatted, big-money addict
Running this shit, now I'm feeling athletic
I'm on a boat, bitch, gettin' sea sick
Stop playin', I'm fresher than a Degree stick
Street shit, well, of course
I smoke mad weed, I'm on my high-horse
Please don't shoot me down, I land feet flat
Then walk a million miles with New Orleans on my back
Hah, I need a massage
And when it come to hoes, man, I got a collage
Finger on the button, nigga, just stuntin'
If you ain't the bank teller, don't tell me nothin'
Kush so strong you can smell me comin'
Bitch, I go hard like the boy from ""300""

I'm gettin' bread like cold cuts, she suck dick till her nose run, yeah

A rich nigga that that shit they don't like
All you niggas pussies, none of you pussies tight
Gettin' head while I drive make me run lights
These hoes wanna ride my dick you gotta hitchhike
No lie, I'm fuckin' bitches and gettin' paid
She suck my dick for 60 seconds and swallow all my Minute Maid
No lie, I'm gettin' paid and fuckin' bitches
The Feds on me, gotta switch plates
In the streets we call that washin' dishes
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on the nine-milly

I bagged your bitch then fuck her
Now come get your bitch from baggage claim, nigga!
Dr. Carter, fuck her harder

And guess what? I'm the barber
I'm too high; if I come down my fat pocket's my shock absorber

But I don't know what most of these bitches be saying anyway
Most of these bitches don't know what the fuck they be saying

Yeah, let's go

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Imogen Heap]
Uh, I break the leg off a bitch
And kick her in the ass with her own shit
I'm getting tired of my own dick
'Cause it keep me up all fucking day and fucking night
It's just fucking all fucking day and fucking night
I can't believe this butter butt fuck a butter knife
My dick get hard when thunder strikes
I need help, I need a light
I know they gonna cross me if they crossed Jesus Christ
I cross my heart, hope to die
Met a bitch that was rich who never seen roaches fly
I took her to the South side, left her ass outside
Legs open mouth wide
I get high like them niggas on that movie How High
Or maybe higher [?] die or live in fear
I hope new rappers disappear
But I ain't worried 'cause they will in a year, haha
It's not even light out
You appear to be a queer
I leave you in a swamp crying crocodile tears, haha
As the crowd cheers, thank you
I thank God every day because I ain't you, haha

But you've somewhere to be
I'ma let that bitch sing

Alright, kiss me on my bullet wound
Before I jump the broom, I'd rather jump over the fucking moon
Your girl just told my girl she wanna lick what's in my underoos
And every time I tell her ""Leave,"" she hate to go like summer school
I spit, I vomit, I pukes, I shits, I number twos
I makes money, makes moves and make fun of you
I jump off her clit and I land on her face
I squeeze on her tits 'til her implants deflate
Bet I jump off some shit and I land on my skate... board
If life is a bitch, mine is Betty... Ford
They try to make me go to rehab
Rest in peace Amy Winehouse
I hope I sign your autograph before I sign out
Merlot color flag with my 9 out

I can make any bitch shit in my hand
And mush it in your face like a pie pan
I used to fuck your girl, but that pussy feel like dry land
Smoking on that good make me look like I'm from Thailand
Fuck y'all niggas, not literally
My girl from Italy
But fuck that shit, I'll make your bitch swallow my little me's
I make the healthiest motherfucker sick of me
And hoes wanna have my baby like Billie Jean
But beat it
Get it? Jerk it off, beat it
It's not even light out
Yeah, and dry pussy tastes better when it's bleeding

I fell in love with a pedestrian
'Cause she walked right over me
I should run over that bitch at a crosswalk
In my new Mercedes, I forgot to dance when she played me like a ukelele
Huh, just another sad love song
Like Toni Braxton, should've played you like a saxophone
At least we coulda made music, instead of trippin'
I bought the bitch a dozen roses with eleven missin'
Huh, she said she wanna be a lifeguard
Bitch, you can't even save yourself, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Huh, I park my dick up in her garage
But I shoulda treated that pussy like a parking lot
Yeah, the players fucked up
She was loose as a goose but I should've ducked
Her, and sure, I still hit her up, but only to say I fuckin' hate you, bitch

[Chorus: Ben]
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face (Yeah)
And now my life is lookin' up now (I-I fuckin' hate when I'm insecure)
And she's already been replaced (Fuck)
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore (I fuckin' feel like I'm about to cry)
No, I don't need her

And she never pissed me off
That's a toilet bowl, no urine
And I used to think about you when I be wit' her
Oh, now you fly?
Bitch I knew you when you were a caterpillar
And homicide, crosses my mind
Once or twice I admit
I feel like an asshole, that ain't never have shit
Now some say love is a drug I beg to differ
'Cause I sniffed her, and I smelt another dick on her breath
And still kissed her
Fuck I'm stupid
I kidnap cupid
And teach him how to hate
Then teach him how to skate
No, you ain't on my calendar, but at least I got a date
To drown you out I buy a house, buy a beach and buy a lake
I fell defeat to my mistakes, but who doesn't?
I heard your man was gay
Does that mean you have 2 husbands?
You fuckin' slut
I'd do better fuckin' sluts up the butt
Then let you come and kiss the shit out my dick, pucker up

I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now
And she's already been replaced

I don't need her anymore
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her
But now she's seemin' insecure
Yeah, yeah, yeah

See, when times get hard
So does my dick
And for some funny reason
I think of you
And um
I just wanna grab a rifle and
Shoot myself in the head because
I-I-I just can't get rid of the thoughts

So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now As a matter of fact, let me take that rifle
And she's already been replaced And I'ma um
I don't need her, you know I don't need her I'ma swing by your crib
I don't need her anymore And um
No, I don't need her I hope your man is there
She know I don't need her I-I still got that key

Oh no, but I'm in space
I don't know if it is this girl face
Or how she taste, but I like it

[Bridge: Lil Wayne] (x2)
(Good God)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
But I like it, ooh I like it
When you doin' it, how I like it
So keep doin' it, how I like it
Cause I like it, ooh I like it

[Verse 2: Boo]
I like sex in the mornin', I like sex at night
I like sex on the weekends, is that alright?
Alright, alright, all night, alright?
Come on, I got shampoo chilled
Took off her dress but kept on the heels
Damn baby, you so exotic
Holler my name loud when I'm inside it
No shame, I ate her pride
Tickled the pearl tongue and came up smilin'
Two dips a dip, and now we ridin'
Bed to the sink, sink to the shower
Back to the sink, back to the bed
It's 3:45, now I'm gettin' some head

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I get cold, I get goosebumps
And I head out the door, that's similar to her name
I'm so cold, but with her, all alone
I'm so high, I'm nearly hittin' the flame
She told me her name is Crazy
And I said ""Hi, they call me Insane""
Crazy and Insane is so high up in the tree
F.U.C.K.I.N.G

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know what I will do
I guess I, I guess I, would just die
Go to Heaven and wait on you

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Ooh, I think I like you
If you was a poem, I would recite you
The bed could be our ring, I wanna fight you
Put my key in your ignition, let me ignite you
The cops keep comin', the cops keep comin'
To my front door like I'm trynna do somethin'
They don't understand that I'm involved with a woman
That love to make noise when she feel it in her stomach
I'mma have to talk to the neighbors
Matter of fact, let me take a walk by the neighbors
I don't know what the hell wrong with the neighbors
And what they expect when an animal is matin'
Knock on the door, like chicky-chicky-check it
Life is a party, don't ricky-ricky-wreck it
Y'all will call the cops and report a domestic
When I'm just trynna kill a problem called erection
Head in the coupe, call it sex on wheels
I'm a big dude, I treat sex like meals
She ride me for breakfast, I'm on top for lunch
And behind her for dinner, for dessert she say ""yum""

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
I sit here alone everyday
Everyday, everyday in living room window
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo?
No time for video games, no sir
No time, no time for SEGA
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into
But I like her, I like her, I like her
And if she leave, I don't know what I'll do
I do know, I'd go to Heaven
And darlin' I'mma wait on you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I like it (Say what?)
I like it (Say what?)
(Say what?)
Yeah, baby
She likes it
She likes it
She likes it
I'm a R.O.C.K.S.T.A.R
Young Mula, baby
She likes it
And she likes it
Cause I do me, how she likes it
I'mma do me, how she likes it
She know I do her, how she likes it
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a love
I'mma make a love movie
I'mma make a movie",Lil Wayne,I Like It,"Boo, Mack Maine"
"[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 1]
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today I took a walk outside and...

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 2]
Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cause promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker, I don't shoot ya; bitch, I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee, nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside and...

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here

Rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas
I swear I got on Saks 5th boxers right now
I'm trynna milk the game as if the game was a cow
I had an Eddie Bauer Expedition seven years ago
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before
I used to wear braids like Jason's Lyric, whoa
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race

Cause I'm a beast, I'm a dog

Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
You know that

[Lil Wayne]
No, never entertain the suckers with the hating bidness (Nah he never did that)
I'm on a yacht playing table tennis
Expensive linin, women sinning
Adultery - compulsively
I'm an arsonist on the beat, blaze fire
The door close to the booth, I feel like a caged lion
Yeah let me loose, now let me get 'em
Cause I ain't going back and fourth like badminton
No I will never drop the ball like bad mitten
And I ain't being conceited, I'm just admitting
I flow cocky, got hand rhythm
I got this bitch on lock like San Quentin
I'm tough daddy, what's popping gangster?
I'm trynna keep my pockets fat like opera singers
So sharp, if you touch me I'll chop your fingers
I'm on top of the game like helicopter angles
I see you niggas, I hope you having fun
I hope you have a gun, this shit is crazy
It's little Baby, I'm here to take it
And it's looking vacant

[Hook - x2]

[Lil Wayne]
Ok, now I'mma go off on 'em, at first I was going soft on 'em
But now it's time to go hard, busting, banging Bogard
Take a shit in yo' yard, take a piss on yo' broad
Make a list of yo' boys, and go and murder them all, huh
Life is short, yeah a midget told me that
And I always thought I was fly like I had a pigeon on my back
But I got decisions on my back, vision on my back
So don't you try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat
I don't rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, all I got to do is tat
Bet I hit my tar-get, like a fucking dart mat
My address is Cloud 9, seek and you shall find
Weezy on da grind, I'm bout my Frankenstein
You know me, yeah, from my Lincolns to my Franklins
See I make that money stretch and connect like an anklet
Keep the bitches running in and out my house like a banquet
And I don't even speak their language, haha

Hey, take a real good look at the boy

WE! Hey!

[Verse 1]
Wayne deep in the grova, out comes the small soldier
Alcohol and douja, bother my composure
Oh lord, am I supposed to be this way?
Do I live no good? This may be wrong but it feel so good
Far from home, I still feel so hood
I got the set on my belly
That shit gon' be there till a nigga get buried
I ain't scary, bring it, I'm ready
I be on them Antera's to the cranberry
Handle the whip like Andretti
And I handle a bitch like my man Nelly
My nick(?) gotta go down down baby... till I uh oh, y'know!
I move a rainbow lambo on mo-mo's
As far as dough go, I'm up like no-do's
Bet I never sweats no ho
I don't get no type of threats from no foe's
I don't threat the po-po's cause I don't respect the po-po's
Many say that I possess a dope flow, and I accept
Cause when I'm being Weezy I'm at my best

And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
""Just as sure as my name is D'wayne"" (Tony! Toni! Toné! sample)

The flow deserving ovation so clap your hands to it
The flow is real so A-man to it, jam to it
..been a minute since Block is Hot, this is man music
..had opinions for Block is Hot but this is grand music
..hand, blew it because the bands who damn igloo it
..and I ram the damn dick to your people's people/
Get mo' booty than Benzino's single, from bi-sexual to bi-lingual
After I sex you up it's ""bye skeezer""
And I see you later baby, I'm a player

And nah I'll pro'lly never kill nobody, but I've pointed my pistol
And those of you who I pointed it at, I'll still kill ya
I'm still familiar wit the hustle
I could go dope, weed or coke, bet I'll never see broke
And I know to never say never but whatever, I never felt better than now
I'm 19, I'm a veteran now
When I.. step out my house I need weaponry now
Fuck around and I bet it be bloaw, YEAH!
And they.. wondering how I get so rich as a child
Remember, I was before Romeo and Bow Wow/
Shit, I had O's way befo' Romeo or Bow Wow
But no disrespect my daughter crazy bout 'em
And.. notice how you notice nothing's fake about me
There's something great about me
And I'm still young so there's plenty more to break about me
And people brace yourselves, place yourselves in these 7 and a halves
You don't know the half, and tell me who can walk my path
Not a soul

Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
This rap shit ain't nothing in me, I swear this shit's like cotton bread
But I still go hard with no regard, Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin

And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite

And I stayed on my flo' at Cash Money, like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim

Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb

The first time I realized I was the best rapper alive
You know what I mean, now before I go into any further in this conversation
Let me let y'all know what I mean about this best rapper alive shit
I don't think I'm better than anybody personally
I don't think I'm better than anybody spiritually
Nahhmean, I don't think I'm better than anybody in any way or form or fashion
But as far as this rap thing, I think I am better than everybody
I'm a competitor, I hope everybody else feels the same way about their craft
You know what I mean, if you do it makes it better for the people
It makes it better for the listeners dawg
And that's how I feel about mine
So, if you're listening and you wanna hear somebody that's dedicated to what they do
I'm so dedicated that I feel I'm the best

[DJ Drama]
See I can understand that
Niggas be saying ""Drama, why you talk so much shit on your mixtapes?""
When you're not grinding I'm grinding to get where I'm at
You understand, believe that
And I won't be saying that I'm the best, but I run this

[Lil Wayne: First ""Dedication 2"" Verse]
Hah, Dedication 2, that's right, you already...
Wake up motherfuckers it's Weezy, you got a problem?
Heads to them Katrina victims, we still mobbin'
Shiny black coupe at night look like a goblin
AK on the backseat, baby it's so-{*record rewinds*}

[Lil Wayne]
Right now, we're gonna hold the fuck up man
See y'all niggas ain't playing close attention right now
Ay Drama, this is what I want you to do man
This is what I really need you to do right now
My nigga Drama, plus he be hitting y'all in the head with that gangster shit
But listen, my nigga Drama man I swear I need you to do
I need you to give me something else for ya now
Just to warm 'em up, and then they gonna...",Lil Wayne,I’m the Best Rapper Alive,

And I ain't playin', I got killers with me, ain't got no squealers with me
And the back of the milk carton say my ceiling's missing
And now my vision blurry and I'm with kissin' cousins
I'll make 'em rob you masked up, you think them bitches muslims

Bitch, I keep that anthrax
I can get your man wacked for a couple tan packs
Shoot off your Sedan Lac

I got ten up on my pinky ring and twenty on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can't say shit

I'm sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money man
It's right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don't wanna be up in that place

I can't stop fucking with these hoes
When I say I'm just doing me

Off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you're hard cause

I told you out the gate I'm not the fake
I gotta say, please excuse
Almost forgot man, I'm Raw Dizzy by the way

Money over bitches, bitch I'm coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I'm coming for your neck

I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot

Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes

Well, give me brains since you a smart-aleck
Fuck her all night and don't smell it
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous

Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover
Just put TV's and bump in the Rover
Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick is just bogus
Fuck a ho watch she come back like a chorus
Like one named Deloris met her in a taurus
She like to snort coke, you should see the size her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
All our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'

Woo, one xan, one xan, one xan, lord, I'm tryna cut back
Hold up, hold up, where my cup at? My bitch got that comeback
Woo, real one from the jump, man, I'm killing the Jumpman

And we pull up, man up and dump and dump and dump then scrrram
Screech! The harder I fall, the farther I reach
The water might fall, but life is a beach
When my number’s called, I get out my seat
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech
You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark, never I before we
And you pray before eating and you lay with your heat
And you stay with your heat and you lay on your mink
Bitches lay at your feet and you play with your kids
You don’t play with these niggas, don’t play on these streets
I don’t play on these beats, I don’t play bout my money
You heard what I say, no replay, no repeat
Don’t be playing with me, don’t be playing with we
I don’t play with no Wii, I’m OK, I’m OG
I’m O.J. on these beats, I OD on these beats
I'm M-O-B-B-B-B on these streets
Say what you say, you don’t be on these streets
Cause if we see you, it’s on S-I-G-H-T

Watch these niggas turning into hoes, bop-bop
Watch me turn a nigga into smoke, bop-bop
Watch me turn a million into four, voilà
Watch me turn Miami to N.O., uh-huh
Watch me turn the sand to some snow, uh-huh

Holla at my baby mamas, I love them the most
Shout out Lauren on the West, she playin' her role (Boogie!)
Literally, on the set, she playin' a role (Boogie!)

So much shit on my mind, I just hope I don't smell like it
The motherfuckers pointing fingers
Be the same ones that have nail bitin'
Real niggas, still real niggas, you new niggas, just lil' niggas
When ya shit fall, don't be surprised
Acting like you didn't hear timber
I'm caffeinated, I'm half-sedated
I started from the bottom, I gravitated
I'm validated, I'm a trigger happy nigga
And it's sad to say it, but I had to say it
I had to do it, I had to stunt, act like I had what I had for once
With all of my thank yous added up
I still can't thank Birdman enough, I woke up in a new Tyra Banks
I've been gettin' money since Shabba Ranks
The car I'm in brand spankin' new, it just got spanked
Real niggas say rest in peace to DJ Screw
Rest in peace to Pimp C too
Fuck your bulletproof vest (blat) I still need proof, my nigga
I hate you like mustard, I'm disgustin'
I'm aiming at your chest, hit your face, I'm just rusty
Cherish every step that we take, some of us clumsy
Lookin' for a breath of fresh air, it's hidin' from me, fuck
Mall roll it up in the leaf, weed stronger than Zangief
I last longer than an antique, her pussy cummin' like a stampede
She cooks, fucks and clean, the type of bitch that every man need
The type of bitch that every man leave
That ain't cool, and she wearin' sleeves, but chill, just chill

Girl, you gotta chill, uh, I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, you know that I'll always keep it real

You could fuck all these bitches, except my bitches
Yeah right, I wish, with all three wishes
Man I swear she got too attached, had to cut the umbilical
Man I swear I'm so armed, I feel like I got tentacles
Niggas bumpin' their gums, I feel like Orajel
Got 'em scratchin' their head, combin' out broken nails
See I give 'em my love, but I'm an indian giver
Got my ear to the streets, I hear the enemy whisper
I break the bank with a sledgehammer
Cellphone rings like Saturn
Bitch let a nigga breathe, breathe like a dragon
I hide money everywhere, that's my hidden talent
One time for them gangstas, fuck that, two times for them gangstas
If you got a problem, I'll fix that like, yeah nigga I'm maintenance
Got a bad bitch and she anxious, bitch, you just an acquaintance
I'll ask a rat, ""Why be a rat?"" then kill him while he explainin'
Tell your foot soldiers to walk light, handful of real niggas left
And if any nigga wanna step to me tell 'em hurry up and take bigger steps
My bitch deep, I get in depth, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
She dyed her pussy hair red, she said she had to roll the red carpet out
That's real
So real

Yeah, you know that I'll always keep it real

My name like honey, got a lot of bitches buzzin'
The neck of the barrel so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunch
And it munch, like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eyes on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on point like an arrow

And let him sing like Gladys Knight and the Pips

Understand, I'm tryna get the chips, and the dip
Better know I hold that gun with a Panther grip
My hollow bullets got tips, like a dancer bitch
Where my money? Where my money? Need to answer quick
Gotta get back up on my ransom shit, and put you (in the trunk)
So you lay on top of speakers
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day on the edge I will leap first
Bet you any money that I will land feet first
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Bigfoot, Harry and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong, and if I have to park
I will open up my trunk and it will be Jurassic Park

Got a early call from Kisha, Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Cristal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak but
They say she keep it cleaned up, but I don't want HIV bruh
I drop my top on da drop-top (I'm bout ready to meet her), her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate
It up like some peanuts
I said ""oooohhhh Kisha""
Chopped off like a millimeter
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go you to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya

[Verse 2: Turk]
Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call, see if it's alright
For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
(Baby) it's all good, I'll be there in a minute
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me peepin at him, but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass ho
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut, now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie

Hit Juve on the hip, let him know it was all good

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Ooohh Oooh there she go, on the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know, we done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed, she told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car all smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it
Hey ho, I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.Geezy on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good up in the alley
Not the telly

[Verse 4: B.G.]
This ho don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on the balls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that ho won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that ho might just fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head, end up doing somethin bad ha

"[Intro: Kobe Bryant]
I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me

[Intro: Stephen A. Smith]
He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Kobe doin' work
2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunkin' on the whole team
Black Mamba, attack, conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

[Interlude: Unknown]
I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in three seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me

[Interlude: Reporter & Unknown Player]
One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James
I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you

Attack you like a beast

And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

Seckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Seckback: Really? Why
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!

[I thought you want to be the greatest]
Uh, do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting

He can't guard me

I get you too high, I hear yo' ears pop
You hear my key chain, you hear the birds fly
All gold dust, pull the pills out
You take your clothes off, you tell me go hard

Ooh, girl I love you so
That's why I always fuck you slow
All these little hoes they come and go
She was just a flame, went up in smoke
And I told myself not to love the bitches
Hard to stop fallin' for a bitch when you trippin'
Hard to stop sleepin' on a bitch when you sippin'
When you sippin'
Can't trust these hoes, can't love these bitches
Then my heart get cold, middle finger with the mittens
Bitches lie through they teeth, I never wanted to be a dentist
Might as well keep spittin', it ain't love it's business

Make me slap ya in ya mouth to get a gum from me
And you know it's only real niggas that run with me
So if I die, probably little niggas will come from me
Shit, it's gonna take like 10 million just to come for me
Yeah, I'm eatin' but I still feel hungry
You know I don't give a motherfuck, yeah I done this shit
And I'm done with it but don't fuck with me

[Chorus]
They tryna get me stuck in a hole
Only got one soul, I know
It's a lot of pressure and pain
But I'm ready for whatever, I'ma mess with that bitch
And everybody open they mouths but they ain't 'bout what I'm 'bout
We can bring it on
We can bring it on

[Verse 2]
Look, and I ain't worried 'bout the law neither
I ain't got nothin' on me, bitch, I'm all legal
And niggas sayin' what they saw talkin' to them people
They got my people in the place without them charges on 'em
And I get charged every day in my charger, homie
And I don't beef with niggas 'cause they all below me
And I don't eat with niggas 'cause we all ain't hungry
It's time to get this money, nigga, fuck your feelings
Who the fuck is gonna take care of your children, shit
Who was there when we were on top of them buildings, shit
I'm over my head, I'm on top of the ceiling
But I'm being real and that's how a nigga feel, fuck
And motherfuck how a motherfucker feel, yeah
I'm tryna feel how I feel to touch a meal
And everybody tryna get a deal
But my mind on these bricks and I'm on the bill

[Chorus]
They tryna get me stuck in a hole
Only got one soul, I know
It's a lot of pressure and pain
But I'm ready for whatever, I'ma mess with that bitch
And everybody open they mouths but they ain't 'bout what I'm 'bout
We can bring it on
We can bring it on",Lil Wayne,Leave Me,Raw Dizzy
"[Intro: DJ Drama]
I realize you niggas is like the objects in the rearview mirror—
You really appear much closer than you are
Got a long way to go, young boy

[Verse 1: Euro + DJ Drama]
Uh
Uh
Check
(Catch up, niggas!)
Let 'em all in, bet 'em all in
Put me in the jungle, I get us all minks
Don't play with my wave
Know what? Let 'em all sink
I don't need therapy, I got so big
Even when they talk crazy I still don't shrink
I'ma black out, Michael Blackson's skin tone
Homie gotta sit for a while back home
Hotline bling if you get his phone
Gotta own up or you get disowned
Eyes dried up, I don't really cry much
And the gold chain match everything I touch
Whip gotta match every bitch I fuck, foreign
Y'all niggas talkin' 'bout what? Borin'
Bane from it, I came from it
I'm raised by it, I'm stained from it
Shot for the stars from the darkness
I aim from it, now change comin'
Who'd have thought a nigga shake somethin'?
All these records, I'ma break somethin'
Playin' my shit around the graveyard
Y'all fuck around and wake somethin'
Mean mug like I hate somethin'
Hit the stu' and I ate somethin'
Great rapper or a great hustler—
Promise you I die a great somethin'

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
And I am beginnin' and endin'
A nigga run in kickin' and flippin'
A nigga worth spendin'
A nigga with the semi admittin'
Glock is definitive on 'em, iron Emmys
Got an eye on 'em
Still on these niggas more than any one of you
We knuck if we buck, if you my brother we up
If not, I don't give a motherly fuck
Only in us we trust, you fuss we hush
They rush we bust, adjust, and dust and flushed 'em
If you don't know what my salary is
You 'bout to know what a fatality is
What the reality is
If I don't know what my calories is
Then nine times out of ten
You won't never know where your cavity is
Hit a forty, know it had to be his
A dude foul with a smile
They would never know how mad that he is
They don't ever know what pattern he is
He gotta be from Earth 2, or somewhere from out on Saturn he is
Now I'm goin' where no gravity is, some other galaxy shit
But we'd rather talk about the MAC and the bricks
We takin' on all names, it ain't no more games
I'm a stand up nigga, Cory Kaepernick bitch
I don't know what to call you
Niggas claimin' they loyal to the soil
But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
To court with the all you
You cannot avoid it when I'm gonna destroy you
Work from the ceiling to make sure that I fall you
I'm dedicated to this rhyme shit
S double, the militia gang, they don't ever try them bitch
I got a nine and click, a high been brick
A bottom bitch, I buy them thick
Drivin' stick, life's a bitch, and I give dick
I ride the five, my partner crip
Shout out the East, we parkin' shit
I just revive, I don't remix
I don't remind, until C5 we got D6, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
The best things in life are free, not cheap, free C5
Message, no reply
Rest In Peace, no peace sign
I keep an eye on these guys
My third eye give her sweet eyes
The bird eye's view keep spy
But I can get your wings deep fried
Try, try again, keep tryin'
All the traffic hours, you a taxi driver, we some maximizers
Ever heard of San Francisco 49'ers, we some masterminders
Made it to the top just to get sniped from the floor at the very bottom
Ain't that a bitch, man tell me about it
But I ain't trippin', unless the trip is private
I sip in silence
I tried to make it beautiful, and this shit came out perfect
Let the guns speak for they self, I ain't never been a loud person
Walkin' 'round the house in the turban
These niggas washed up with no detergent
Take your heart and I am not a surgeon
Pullin' triggers like shower curtains
Ain't got no soul because my baby sucked it out of me
Me and my whoas in Las Vegas playing the thot machines
Stick to my goals, expectations like a soccer team
Waiting to exhale only to let out some steam
Girl let's make a movie, what's a movie without a shower scene?
Treat my semi like an Emmy, need some nominees
Taught me how to count before they taught me how to read
I knew all my OG's before my ABC's

Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""
""Let that shit work itself out""

[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]

Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""

And if you getting out of line, I hang you with a clothing line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line

Nigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream ""fuck 'em all!""
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'

Don't make me take ya, play ya

Call it a caper, won't be no as-salamu alaykum
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me

None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
'Cause all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone

I pop dozens of Glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

I hope my wife know she got a playa for life and that's no bullshittin'
I push love to its full limit
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called memory
And I know you in that lane with me

Heh, c’mon
Just a snare and a 808
Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A
OK, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle
From giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350
Tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'mma take it one-two-way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool
At Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool
As I blew by you
Hello, hi you
I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you
Feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing
I show and prove
And show improvement
And I know just to go into it
Could never amount to going through it
Whatever or how you wanna do it
We can do it like we late
Ay, wait
Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch

Damn
I'mma get in a nigga chest like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fucking ram
On the hunt for the lamb
I'mma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam
Hair nappy like Pam
Nigga fuck your plan
Fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man
And fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh god damn
There's my sam–ple
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared
Suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos, and I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat bitch

[Chorus]
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now what's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, they say

Like I dropped straight from heaven
Five strong words: rest in peace Lil Kevin
And this ain't how I was born
But this is how I live
So that's how I'll die, and do not close my eyes
So when you see me in the casket I'm a look right back at ya
Cause I don't trust none of y'all
Fuck every one of y'all
Now which one of y'all wanna brawl?
And overall I got that pistol under all of my garments
Torment, torture
Tragedy, catastrophe
No battery, just murder in the coldest temperature
And that means first degree
Even deaf motherfuckers done heard of me
I ain't gonna let you motherfuckers worry me
And tell that beef I'm Burger King

I'm so high I can paint signs
And if she ain't fine, she ain't mine
Thank god that I'm alive

The Lord is my shepherd
You haters can't harm me
I walk with his blessings
The angels be my army
Of course there's a weapon on my waist within arm's reach
That's my baby keep it strapped in like a car seat (yes)
Though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death
Forgive me Lord I had to carry my tech
I touch cash and get cheese
Play with that cash I bust mags, indeed
Forgive those who trespassed against me
For they know not what they do until they history
Gone, memories
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
Like what happens when I get up with my enemies
Paybacks, penalties
Bang back, send em' these
Funerals, these people got to waste more Hennessey (yeah)
They got to pour it on the floor for ya
Maybe next time they'll pray a little more for ya

Devil I'm rebuking ya
Lord have mercy on my soul when I'm suited up
Daddy was a hustla, mommy was a Christian
Momma said prayers, daddy steady cookin' chicken
If I'm living life wrong, I don't wanna be right
Send me blessings to the cloud, hope I make it through the night
Dear Lord as you lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
Then I pray to the Lord my soul to take
There shall be no other god before thee
Lord please forgive me of my sins if I O.D, slowly
I know I should not kill but I will
If a nigga try to shoot me and lay me still
I'm so sorry for the wrong thing's that I've done
This the end of my prayer we all say amen

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Dear God
As I begin this day, my thoughts turn to you
And I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do
Give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind
And with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find
Let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you
Will see I get my daily bread
Give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run
And let me keep this thought in mind ""Thy will, not mine, be done.""
And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee
Please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me
I've failed you many time, I know
But tonight when I rest
I hope that I can say, ""Dear God, I've tried my best....rapper alive.""",Lil Wayne,Let Us Pray,"Juelz Santana, Kidd Kidd"

Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery, one me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Pop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm, lil nigga
I’ll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl
Make em share the same dick

I just hope I’ll be alive to see a Dedication 6

Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit
And niggas know I’m on another level with this shit
I’m pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit
All I need is a shovel and a ditch
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is
Run in his home and show me where the kids
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge
That’s me, him nigga

Black jeans, grey tee, old Tim’s nigga

You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, ""Don't mind the little voices"" (Woah)
What's sharper? Spikes or Mr. Carter
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the swishers, roll 'em tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got-
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter

Got some hoes from California and they shit smell like begonia's
Got a bone to pick, I'm boneless, that's a bonus
Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, pop up at the spur of the moment
How you want it?
When in Hell, I'm a Roman
Head on fire, I'm a comet, heat up out my abdomen

Business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, I turned her to a business woman
Mind your business, I'm like-

What's harder? Love or Mr. Carter
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, what's wrong or right? And what's the order?
I know this AK will get shit right and fix the toilet
I'll be a-okay as long as my wife could cook a quarter
The type of shit I won't take for granted, need the marble
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, aka no cartoon, no Hanna-Barbera
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cat and cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups and downs and back and forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on ya
Throw a five in the air for C5 like, ""Hi, how are you?""
Shit, what's harder? Drugs or Mr. Carter?
The world is on my shoulder, I shrug to get it off from shit
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder? Murder or abortion?
Woah, what's harder? Death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, ""Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?""
Shit get hard, but I'ma termite to turmoil
Was it easier to change diapers or back to normal?
Times are changing like Father Time just lost it's father
What's harder? To ask for sorrow or to borrow
Or to propose and get ""I don't know""?
I don't know

Alot of niggas better move out
Cause here I come with my click
With the tools out
All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to lose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brains
No matter the weather
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
I'mma slangin' that metal
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood
To get it together
Cause I'm with tola, mario
And we down for whatever
Never underestimate or you goin under, see
Y'all can keep playin with Lil Wayne
But that lil' boy trouble
And plus dis shorty be full, wodie
Be scorin bundles, then start wildin'
Hit the block and let his toys rumble

Ima fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em
And got my Glocks rammin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us
I chief three blunts
So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush
I'm sick and tired
Niggas choose to test the water
They get hit and die
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partners get lit up
And then they ask why?
That's cause you played wit' me
They could'nt of known im'a guerilla
Drama stayed with me
Ran in his home went to kill him
Took his head with me
You better get it right or keep it right
Or lose your whole town

I just unwrapped a brick
Put it on the scale, it come back thirty-six
It come back thirty-six
Then that's when we whip, we mastered the wrist

Live from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy Flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go –
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down
It's going down like there's a whale in the boat
See, you can smell that I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination, it make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water, yep, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the Squid
L-L-Lilly pad niggas, l-l-look at the monster
Y-Y-You don't want to crash, like La-La-La Bamba
See it's me, Roney, and Terry
And my new drop is berry
Watermelon, plum, just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper getting new bucks
And all you new rappers, you're just new lunch
Flow sick, so sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster, like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tock, before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, ""Gimme a sec""
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm running this bitch, like Eric Bieniemy back
'Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out ""Where the sympathy at?""
Yeah, if you betting money, baby, him'll be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch, I'm finna be that
I walked right in hip hop, like ""Where my dinner be at?""
I ate that, and I was like ""Where my dinner be at?""
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants, quiet, neither them that
A lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill, I can fuck you for an hour with that
And to the kids – Drugs kill, I'm acknowledging that
But when I'm on the drugs, I don't have a problem with that
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers, biatch
And we aiming right at your fucking collar, biatch

They need to stop it, niggas don't like when you
Balling on them bitches, they just mad ‘cause they ain't got shit
And niggas with the gossip, ol' Dr. Phil ass nigga
You might as well go 'head on and start a talk show

Yep we do shine, and they gon' hate
But they hated Jesus baby we won't break
So we ride like four Pirellis, so secured
No security, no protectin no comparing
Locin' and heavy, Ocean 11
Aviators, vote-takers, so fakers, ah!
No playas, I'm Holly Grove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start, don't cross Earhart
Boulevard where the ward I come from
One-seven, one shot? Never that, blum-blum!
Brrr, brrr, pop, pop, clap, clap
What the fuck! Hollygrove, stand up! Duck! (Nigga!)

[Chorus: Kurupt]
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now it's time to floss (We lock and load!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get 'em, get 'em, Weezy! Hit 'em where you kill 'em, easy
Sit 'em in the river, leave em, they find 'em tomorrow evening
Sinkin, I'm prob-ly drinkin that syrup
Thinkin I won't slip, even though I'm leanin like a broke hip
He don't know I got the nina wit the full clip
That's a somersault, backspin, full-flip for ya
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin, I'm just bustin until this scene clean
Twelve hundred for the jeans, stop playin
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants
Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect, I
Strap a jet black gat 'til the death
Tell the mama to bury me with that, no bullshittin'
My hood getting kinda crazy where I be
So Ronnie's with me cuz he's the OG (Nigga!)

[Chorus: Kurupt]
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now its time to floss (We lock and load!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Fresh out the back seat of the Phiggity-Phantom
The haters, I make 'em madder when I wave at 'em like, ""What up?""
If it ain't about money I keep goin
I'm tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn, but fuck--
Them boys, I got the shottie on my arm
If them boys run up, I leave their bodies on the lawn
And duck the fuck outta there, 'cause baby, it's outta there
If this was a movie, it's time to roll the credits, cut!
Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin' block!
I'm a motherfuckin' rock!
Hardbody, Eagle Street, seventeen shots
Night vision double-clip, hot steady beam Glock
Pop! Drop, little man, drop!
This is not for little bitches, you man or a fox?
I'm layin in the drop, thinking of more money
Cash money, Young Money, take money, your money

[Chorus: Kurupt]
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now it's time to floss (We lock and load!)",Lil Wayne,Lock and Load,Kurupt

[Verse 1]
All I know is paper
I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap
And pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon
It's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy
Keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind
And bodies on my nine
And I swear everyday
I'm on my Ariana grind
De
I got that yay
I got that ladidadida
And a kamikaze squad
And you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man
Like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove
Turnin' O's
To octagons
I get money while I'm sleep
I dream that I'm in heaven
I dreamed I saw Lil Beezy
And smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, Rest In Peace
And my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep
They catch him
When he least expect 'em
Momma told me
""If you run these streets
Run these streets correctly""
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows
I wear new clothes
To the mall
Two hoes
On my arm
Fur boots
When it's warm
Church shoes
To play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper
I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you
Neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him
Better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy, 'cause they done sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zero's
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper
Big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is
That bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience
'Til I heard all aboard
They mad cause I be skatin'
At home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5k
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London
Y'all don't hear me

[Interlude]
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 2]
Hol' up
Had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up
Roll some more up
Watch me go up
My doors go up
When I show up
Why you show up?
Pick my bro up
Pick a O up
Hit the store up
Get a soda
Get us 4 cups
Split a 4 up
Then we slow up
Yeah you know us
Then we toast cups
And we post up
Don't approach us
We got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust
Give no fucks
Take no stuff
And take your stuff
Then ho hunt
For some chocha
I know a ho
Who'll rock the boat
But I row her
I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita
I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres
Oh Lord
I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms
He died recent
So I hope heaven made more room for him
And I hope he see me
Cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy

[Verse 1]
It's Lil Weezy for real
Only Cash Money Hot Boy that stood still
I got a good deal
I'm from a trill hood
I smoke real good
Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood
Pipes, rally stripes and fog lights
T-shirt white, three stripes with all ice
What that boy name
Birdman Jr., huh
Four was mild but five is so wild
I can smoke a green mile
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby
Bling-blow, I rock a throwback Jordan 23
Rolling on hot 23's
Tote a big Glock 23
You're looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans
My block living me
I want you to look hard at some easy money
Stop playing this is Weezy company
Uh-huh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the son of Cash Money
The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Cuz I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bed
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint
Ladies on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Somethin' on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some call me Weezy
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'mma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze
So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas
And beating went to the A
Eat with Jazze Pha
But yeah I'm on my way
Cuz I know he got that hay
Hey little mami
You a ghetto fire tin
You come to my post on the island
Come on that chronic
He-he empty vodka bottles
I be high he be drunk that my roll model
I rolls by you with my seat reclining
When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding
Cash Money what you hollering, huh

[Hook]",Lil Wayne,Look at Me,
"[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
I put piss stains on private planes, cause it's my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my Rottweilers drink Moët
Diamond baguette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost three nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got a Benz, a Prowler, playboy, and a 'Vette
Tell the truth -- who fucked you on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the N.O. to New York
Who got every bitch's attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking about, look -- y'all dont know?
I'll give you a hint: see that bitch you with?
He fucked that ho
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, it's like 'Harlem World' video
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know
Shorty, when the next time I'mma be up in your bed
I love you? You love me?
Well go 'head on and gimme some head

I told 'Soul' I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing, these hoes doing hella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20-inch chrome
Give me the key, the car, ho, and the alarm
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20-inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the chopper's mine
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Bought it to tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the VC's and TV's so a nigga could shine
Let my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

I ride the best, from a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a repper, Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moët, and Crissy, see that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring yo bitch around me cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different, that's your issue
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her
Whole city sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at B.G. watch, that bitch bling-a-ling-a-ling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 G's or better
Me and Wayne take the left, Juve and Baby take the right
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light
Cash Money Millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga Weezy said, we surrounded by ice

Lamborghini sitting on broaders with two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari with Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome, vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em
I'm back, I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the Hummer, hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jet's about to land
The women fall out when I let them touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20-inch fans, damn
Goddamn, man, I am, L-I-L, Weezy, off the heezy
But still in awe, ice floodin' on my watch
And in my grill and all, Porsche Box', front blocks

Thank you
I've been through it all
The fails, the falls
I'm like Niagara
But I got right back up, like Viagra
I am agri-culture
Swagger so mean it might insult ya
Hah, I'm like an ultra-vulture
I fuck around and catapault ya
Torture
Thought ya
Parents taught ya?
You guys is chocha
I'm gone, buenos noches
Flow scorcher
And I don't even write
No author
So harder
So smarter
All about a dollar
Like four quarters
Oh Father
Will tonight be my last?
And if so
Make sure my kids see my cash
And I know
I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!

[Hook]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way
'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it
Say I need it

[Verse 2]
C-A-R, T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-er
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, spit sickle-cell psycho
I go
Off, like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from
The underground baby, like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles
Until the light blows

[Hook]
And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling
Living what I believe in, dog
And it's a problem when our homies not eating
And I'm greedy
I'm greedy

[Verse 3]
Share my blood
Feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Gray's Anatomy
Acid, like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Ay, Juelz
I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches tryna kick it like Juntao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off, like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby – Great

[Hook]
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G –
It won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until you're riding to the late me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him every day for my achievements
And I'm Weezy

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy

Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Bad Vibes
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

And she don't do the phone thing, she do the finer things

She all about her certain ring and not all kind of rings
All about the sure things and not the shiny things
Man, she so tired of swervin' niggas, need a tire chain

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it

I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the sorrow
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise to be loyal

Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face

One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now I feel lovely, I feel great
I slide in: safe

Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

[Bridge]
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess

My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 2]
Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

[Bridge]
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost

Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin'""
She say, ""What's missin'?"", ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed""
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Uh)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do? [sniffing]
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah",Lil Wayne,Mona Lisa,Kendrick Lamar

Yea, are we there yet? Hopping off the clear jet
Rocks got my neck scratched, ice got my ears wet
Dice game, big benz, tell that nigga spend his ho
Drop a hundred-thousand on the diamond, what we livin' fo
Shit why we hustlin'? Nigga why you buggin'?
My money like PMS, shit come monthly
Here come your woman, with all that lustin'

Bitch all in a nigga bed like covers
Bitch go down, so low like shovels

Finger nails still smell like plastic
Rubber band marks on the wrist is a habit
Rubber grip Glock protect me like a bandage
Tell your girlfriend, I got a log for a cabin
Tell your boyfriend, I'm a dawg he a rabbit
Bitch I got stashes, from the mattress to the attic
And we smoke patches of the cabbage, dramatic
Tell the weed-man, that I'm a fuckin' fanatic

If she make it to me, i'ma make the ho an actress
Maxin' Relaxin' hiding behind the glasses
I have your family, ridin' behind the casket

The grass gotta grow, the bears gotta be fed
Don't come near the cage, if you ain't got no bread
We ain't nothing but a gang, and i'm the honcho head
I ain't never had nothing, but some money to turn to
Some bitches to toss up, some weed to burn through
If this real shit, then this don't concern you
The days of my life, i'm just free to journal
Thumbing through the pages, i'm tryin' to learn you
It's hot down south, keep your heat in the thermal
It might be a surprising cuz the shit ain't normal
Man the shit just terrible, but the shit ain't changing
Look how one band [...] make the changes

But Lil Wayne is the city's angel
Guess who's remaining after all that drainage

"[Verse 1]
Baby momma say I ain't shit
Make a nigga feel like shit
Talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'till they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where'd I leave it?
I hope I leave more of an impression
And all of my blessings for my kids and Ms. Cita, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
My new bitch left me
She said she felt too disrespected
It made no sense to me
But not to the people closest to me
And that's why she left
My smile just left
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I’ll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
There go the tears, there go the drank
There go the pills, you know the drill
Sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my reason?
What am I here for? That's the question
Hmm, my children
That was easy, so easy, uh

[Verse 2]
Loved ones say I don't love 'em
Make a nigga feel like nothin'
A bitch said we never make love
Make a nigga feel like fuckin'
I just tell my kids, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Smokin' all this motherfuckin' weed
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame a lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
And I'm higher than a cable bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
And I never leave my grind, that bitch so magnetic
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
Hmm, my children
That was easy, so easy

And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia

In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""

I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro

And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve",Lil Wayne,Mr. Carter,JAY-Z

I've been standin' here waitin', Mr. Postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card, or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning home to me, Mr. Postman

[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's right darling, aha
Yeah, It's ya baby, baby, ha

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I got her waitin' on me, she lookin' down the block
She see me walkin' up and she run to the mailbox
She say it feels she's up in a cell block
And I open her cell lock, I'm the (Postman)
Just come to make my mail drop, more masculine than him
I'm nastier than him, I'm passin' her and him
In something faster than them
And then he like, ""Damn, there go that bastard again, he the (Postman)""
And she correct him, and I respect her
And he protect her, and she neglect him
And he caress her, and she molest me
He must be weak cuz me, I'm just the (Postman)
And when her man home, I'm the ghostman
Why you think she holdin that pillow close, man?
Why you think she won't open the bathroom door?
She's no whore, she want more of the (Postman)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Girlfriend snatcher, I don't care if you're attached
If that's her, then that's her
And that's me to smash her
Now she hangin' up her high ass skirt, on the (Postman)
Hehe, yeah baby I got that comeback
I'm at your walls like a thumbtack
So Miss Humpback, I know what to do with all that
Fall back, I'll put you a sinner, in the (Postman)
That's big talk for a little guy
But I'm walkin' without reply
She got her legs up, she tryin' to walk in the sky
She callin' for God, and she callin' on I, she say (Postman)
I'm like, ""Yeah baby, I'm right here baby
He's here baby!"" She like, ""Yeah baby!""
Heres a chain letter and some magazines
Keep it clean, he will never think it was the (Postman)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, she love my gangsta, she feel my swagger
I'm there every week just to give her her package
I pick up her bills and I pick up her taxes
You might find a few stamps on your mattress from the (Postman)
She want young holly grove in a envelope
I'm her private note and you ain't gotta know
I'm her fantasy, she always got letters on the canopy
Waiting for the (Postman)
No postal service, I just got my social workin'
And your girl is lurkin', and this world is dirty
And your girl is nervous, to give me head in the convertible
I'm the (Postman)
Yeah, kind and curtious, she love that in me
She love me in her, and I love that plenty
It never fails, sorry homeboy
But you've got mail, I'm the (Postman)

Bump Johnny Cash when I cruise through
Two cokes still a hot boy
But I'm too cool, I'll hold a grudge 'till I beat whoever I lose to

Had to turn them B's to A's
Now im turning words to paper
Turning birds to haters fry their wings and legs
I prefer a leg, I deserve a raise
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread
I ain't burn the bread
Made it gold instead turning more than heads
Take a lemonhead, turn it into bread
Got the golden dreads, got me on the meds
Had a talk with Tez about me on the meds
Forgot the shit he said, I'm out here on the edge
Don't try to sell me, Reg

I'll pop off on sketch

And such and such killed such and such
The streets talk
And bullshit walks
On crutches, but
It's strut to strut
Niggas panic
Button pressing
The end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time
Where the ten commandments
Are now suggestions
How depressing
How infested
Click-clack, pow; intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses
With tight pussies, I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears
So keep it acapella
Based on a true story
We not worried, y'all too worried
I faced my fears
And told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous
Dread head from New Orleans
Where the youth, them got two choices
Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you
We murdered them

All he see in my face is murda
Waste a burna is my waste a furnace
I'm pacing turners your face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga wake up on the wake up
Lay down and a model bitch ache up
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough taped off of this day pub
Race off like some motherfucking make up
Take off looking for something to take up
Want the paper? Or you want in the paper?
Not horoscopes but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga 30 for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much you sneezing dick
Believe in me I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip

Pop the pills for the pain but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rapper man the back soaking gang
Cartier frames got them looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard in the rally same?
Lowkey can still get a brick off my name
Now I'mma tell you this here for my youngin and them

If there ever was a problem watch them pull up quick

And I put some carats on my bitch's wrist
Put some carats on my bitch's fist
Put some carats in my bitch's ears
I came fast money, let's go
And my heart goes out to Vegas, keep it real

Flew 'em back to Vegas with some gifts

In love, but all these hoes is weird
These hair triggers, I might grow a beard
Brazy, yeah, but you know the drill
I'm way up there, you right over here
Have you ever seen the light hit my grill?
I stand there and smile in the mirror
Snap my fingers, dollars appear
Out of nowhere and I don't do L's
And I married the mob when I was like twelve
Turned out well, like Tom and Giselle
Ain't readin' texts 'cause I'm readin' checks
I don't text 'cause that is finger sex
Then I'm turnin' off my ringer next
Airplane mode, no I'ma need a jet
I'm dope, babe, I need a needle set
Chains rock it, can't see the neck
Pockets crowded like the Beatles set
I drop it off and gave Ms. Cita that
Whip milky, I'ma sip filthy
I sip this shit just like it's healthy
Who spilt it, wait my bitch guilty?
Uber, Uber; she'll be missed dearly
Sincerely, yeah it's yours truly

Rockin' Louis while the pot brewin'
With a Chinese bitch that look like thot suey
Told the straight hoes I'm taken
Told the gay hoes I'm vacant
Took some diamonds out her old bracelet
Put 'em on the quotes in my statements
I'm a born slanger, a born slanger
One more time, I'm a born slanger
Draco like a volcano
You can fuck around and get your star spangled
Barbaric, yeah your bitch starin'

It ain't all about the werewolf
It's all about what the wolf wearin'
You a popped cherry, yeah a Cherry Bomb

Shots sprayed like Malaria
Hit your head like a Triceratops

Never looked into my Daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on

On (I'm gone)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line – On your mark, set, pow",Lil Wayne,My Heart Races On,Jake Troth

And hi, your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, uh

Wake up, I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
Makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup, I see that bitch as just average
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi
Looking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie
'Bout to hook up with my whoadies
Got the hook up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka, I'm reloading
And according to my darling this dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely, I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy, she told him ""My phone was roaming""
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill

They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals, religion

Her name went, from whatever-it-was

Rebanged it, rotation
Her guy, he's nameless, he ain't shit
Always on the same shit, poor baby

I pour up so much they call me Pour Baby
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barr Baby

What in tarnation? No information, no statements
Young mula, old mula, mula all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac

Gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on

Doing tricks, call me 'trick Swayze

I’ll be your fishing pail and you can be my yacht buddy
Take you from A-Z, I’ll connect the dots hunny
Day viewers got money, baby cause I got money
I like it the B-5050, what you got for me?
It could be some bread, nah it ain’t gotta be cash
I’ll take a little head or I’ll take a lotta ass
I’ll take a friend or two, we can have a 3D weedy
I could toss you a Gudda Gudda or Lil Weezy, Weezy
Or my nigga Peedy Weedy, or my nigga Tity Tity
Fuck you on the hood of red strip and green Lamborghini
Go head and take this x-pill, that there buck you up
Probably have you walking round like “Damn, what the fuck”
Lady in streets but in the sheets girl you such a slut
Smash you on a top bunk, that’s a banger uppercut
And everyday we do brunch, everyday we do lunch
You do me, I do you
Baby we could do us and I ain’t gotta say no more
I don’t talk too much
Thus far, phew I feel like I’ve been trying to sell a car
Is you buying?

'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows?
Nigga, not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad bitch better than a veterinary
Eat a bad bitch 'less she got that hairy, hairy
I could take her ex out of her vocabulary

[Chorus]
I, yeah got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say ""Why?"" I say ""Why?""
He say ""Damn, my nigga, never mind,"" oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
No, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 2]
We ain't no junkies, but today, we're like Snow White
Whatever we like, she don't judge me
Though I may need her to be the one to give me life
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Never mind

[Outro]
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say ""Why?"" I say ""Why?""
He say ""Damn, my nigga, never mind""",Lil Wayne,Never Mind,

Just ball, baby, just ball, baby
Ain't nothing to me
Money ain't never been nothing to me
You understand me?
Ain't nothing to me
Ain't nothing to me
Spend as much as you feel baby
I told the bitch it's just money

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm about to start using hundred dollar bills to twist a kill, that's for real
We've been on the road to riches, I told Stunna pass the wheel
Man, I just bought a painting for half a mill, that's a steal
Shit, when I'm an artist myself for crying out loud, that's a tear
In a backyard, where the dog at? Driveway where the hogs at?
Can't beat this shit, nigga, Lord knows I fought back, I fought back
We live nigga, let's broadcast, you caught that
New car get brought back if that motherfucker don't haul ass
I swear I had a Lexus coupe, it was Pepsi blue
It was shockingly gorgeous, it was electro-cute
I need a screw, the loose change extra loose
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute, fuck it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Both & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me

You understand me? We going to another country with this chopper, this is ballin'
Yeah
You understand me? Blow a quarter mill

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'ma park my Royce on the grass at your bitch house
Talk that shit, I'm shit-mouth
I flip this money, baby
Watch that perfect dismount
I say thank God all my bills paid
Knock on wood, my mama good
Knock twice 'cause she gave me life
Don't forget that, your honor could
Man, niggas be jacking these days
Only thief I know is Robbin Hood
But I'll pay for that trial nigga
Gotta protect my lively-hood
Look at all the bullshit I've endured
My lawyer said I matured
Talking 'bout them dead presidents
Breath smell like embalming fluid

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Vacation, vacation
Keep the weed in rotation
Don't give up the location
I'll send you back to population
Man, I feel like making donations
And I don't need no standing ovations
I bought my bitch some new shit
And told her I don't care if you break it, it's just money

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Both & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Money don't matter
Money don't mean nothing to me
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
It ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me

Money's never a problem
It never really mattered too much to me, to me

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne with Birdman]
I got money to burn, fire hazards
Lil Tune the monsoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got rugs I never stepped on
Beds I never effed on
I'm in that upper echelon
Your empty pockets echoing
I still ride for my niggas
Money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
And I like nice things and bad bitches with cab fare
More money, more problems
I'm surprised I still got black hair

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I feel like a vacation, vacation
We gon' need vaccination
Don't give up the destination
I'll send you back to population
Man, let's leave out our situations
Leave our tribulations
I got old money, generations
Where's my cheque book? I'm spending pages, it's just money

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Both & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Some niggas might call it trickin', we call it takin' care of your broad
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga, yeah
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I swear to God we gon' ride high, and stay fly, and stay high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money don't mean nothing to me
You understand me, baby?
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing, money don't mean nothing to me (Money, money)
It ain't nothing to me
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
It don't mean nothing
I already paid that price
Money don't mean nothing

I got pussy in my lunch bag
I got soap and I got towels
Bullet showers lead to bloodbaths
I got hoodies that say 'Young Money'
I got bitches that steal them from me
They go home and then they send pictures
To my phone with nothing under it
What am I to do? I'm lovin' it
I run a bad-ass bitches company
That's my company, my bitches humble me
I saw your bitches, that was comedy
I got the romedy, oops I meant remedy
I got the chemistry, and the amenities
Up in my bedroom, holding assembly
They leave feelin' good; physically, mentally
Meditate, meditate; think about yesterday
Fuck what that nigga say, think about yesterday
I can't do everyday, I could do very late
Just hit me up and now go check my resume
Get out that Chevrolet, jump in this better Wraith
I know you see the doors open like Heaven Gates
She think I'm Heaven sent, and I would not forgive every sin
But I forget everything
Thanks to the medicine, thanks to the purple stuff
I'm finna pour it up, I'm finna stir it up
If I had a heart it'd be a purple one

Uh, them hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don’t let it blow up in your face slime
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a motherfuckin' K9
We murk niggas in the day time when the birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'
Everybody got automatics like cockin' back is too time-consumin'
Bought my bitch her own business so she can stay the fuck out mine
But she know hoes, hoes ain’t nothin' but hoes, ain’t good for nothin' but a house fire
Got a .9 right by her panty line, she’ll blow you away like a dandelion
And before they cross me, they’ll nail me to it
And I'ma dance when it's hammer time
My insides fucked up, and it feels so good to be vandalized
And these bars is handlebars, 'cause when I spit, I handle mine
God made dirt and dirt don’t hurt, that’s a lie
Cause I come from that dirty-dirty, and I know pain like raps and rhymes, my nigga
Doing big things, big wings, dragonflies
If I don’t live to see tomorrow, all my kids got daddy's eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I hustle, hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
Take these bitches breath away, resuscitate
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put in over time, that’s why I get paid the big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make the .46 yet

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer
Fuck around and you can get shot up, like a low angle
Old ass money, I been ballin’ my nigga
And I been stop wearing Versace
'Cause I was wearing Versace when Pac was wearin' Versace

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, real niggas say, ""Woo woo""
And such and such kill such and such
The streets talkin', bullshit walks on crutches but it strut the strut
Niggas panic, button pressin', the end is coming, count your blessings
We livin' in the day and time, where the Ten Commandments are now suggestions
How depressin', how unpleasant, click-clack, pow intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies, I found the crevice
High socks, and tie-dye shirts
My fashion statement is a run-on sentence
Pussy niggas still making me sick
Kill all them niggas, no more symptoms

[Verse 3: Flow with Lil Wayne]
I’m smokin' weed in my tool shack
I'm gettin' twisted like Allen wrenches
Bitch, come dance with the devil nigga like ballerinas in catechism
Got a AK with a shell-catcher
And I'll pistol whip ya 'til your head swell up
No Xanax, just coke and Henny
I had to kick that shit like 4/20
And I hit yo' ass with the SIG Sauer (Boom)
Had them put you back together like a jigsaw
And I'ma still bring that bacon home
I don't really give a fuck what the pigs thought
A pussy-ass rat, that's Tom and Jerry (Yeah)
I was gettin' fat off of commissary (Yeah)
And rest in peace to my nigga Soupy (Yeah)
I've been goin' in since Slime was buried (Suwoop)
And in jail, them snacks like bags of money
Just imagine what I had before a bag of cookies
A new deck of cards and a bag of coffee
Get you poked up dead in the shower, bloody
It's fucked up but it's safe to say
For the last seven months, I felt right at home (True)
And with the same pen that they stabbed you with
I'll wash that bitch off and go write a poem (Ugh)
Niggas sleepin' on me, had to shoot one time just to see who'd wake
I don't see your fate but I can see you fake
I gotta light my grass just to see you snakes
Bitch, life is a gamble
Pay up what you owe boy
No drive-bys like they did Ricky
I'm hoppin' out like Doe Boy

On the edge, just one step away so step away

I’m a try it again, I’m a riot insane
I’m a lion my mane hangs down to my strings
And they’re tied to the game, I stay dry when it rain
I’m tried of the fame
Got everything to gain and I’m proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane besides we’re the same
Whose guiding the train, whose flyin’ the plane
Whose drivin’ the lane
Who dies when it bang, who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain, who cries when they sang
You hide but you can’t, you hide but you ain’t
I advise you to thank, you’ll find what you can’t
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank, the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank, combined with my strength
My time and my length, I’m a iron out the kinks, yes I’m on the brink
And in the eye of a wink, I’m a retire in the bank yeeaahhh

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
No I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeaaahhhh I, I’m gon’ get it, I, I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeeaahhh
Cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Sshh, victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy’s misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively
You can’t harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually
You’ll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of this is what you did to me
Nothin’s what you did for me, nothin’s what you give to me
I take whatever I’m visualing
Now break all of the limiting, now shake all of the gimicking
The fakery, the trickery, nurse how sick is he, worse I’m sickening
I’ll be at the finish line first
How quick is he, I’ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain’t with the bickering, I’m full of dignity, I’m full of energy
Pull out the inner me or bull after dinner meat
I stood in the winter heat, it could be the end of me, but good be defending me yeeeaaahhh

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeaahhh I’m allergic to cheatin’
I hate failure and I’m in love with achievement
Above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize
And I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin’ begun with the preachin’
Now pray until I am one with the deacon
Now play until I have won whatever we win
I play until I have won and then I re-win, yeeeaaahhhh

And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter

That bitch is nasty for real, she naked in heels
Fuck Tom, Dick, and Harry and Bill

Very concealed, I got whatever you feel
I got blow like Derek Foreal
I got that white like Jaleel
I'm 'bout that life and that's real

Fuck the neighborhood watch
As soon as enough money is in my knot
I'm yellin ""Who got them keys""
Like the game's on lock
My aims on, I'm locked
Like I spot
But my eyeballs are gunshots, they pop
Outta my head
When you show me the bread
And I bet I could get a chicken
If you sold me an egg
Have ho's walk the strip
Like they owed me a leg
And it's money over bitches

I gotta figure it out before she wake up in my head
Get my shit I gotta get her I gotta get her outta here
I swear the game play was smart, suppose to be in and out of here
But it didn't go that way so I called up Spitter
Cause he liked her anyway when he saw me with her
Thats how we do, how we did it how we get her
Young money in this bitch, fuck them hoes, fuck them niggas. yeah
And I know that they can't fuck with me, because of the
Way I am so comfortly, running the, fucking G

Running round the city buying everything you niggas make
Niggas can't fuck the way I rock
Thousand dollars on the sock
Hot boy get up bitches, outlawed....

So motherfucking fly, that is so motherfucking lie
I know Jesus is watching this session looking at me like
Thank you Lord, you know I try so hard
So if they try me Ima spank em for it
Now Im all up in her mouth like a cancar sore

You like to link the whore, I think of her, as a whore
Like what the fuck you thinking for?
What is wrong with that mind of yours?
She's a dinosaur, she's a Teranosaurous Rex for sex and
Fly as a Terracdactal, I very spectacular
Every move is emaculate though magnificent
Living it up and giving my ten percent to the man up above
Thats probably why I am significant
Ain't gotta tell you about how I finish it
You can look in my face and experience it you bitches
Never been with that bullshit so dont you bring it around me
Im from tear it up avenue right off of get down street you know me I say
Never hesitate, always had a pistol, never been afraid to show
Let it whistle like du du du dudu, du du du
Still creepin on my side, will kill you if you try
Give my money to my momma she will give it somebody
Thats my little biddys brother, hes a bad motherfucker
Im smart hes tougher who will survive?

I got Young Money up, and now I got my feet up

Doing what the fuck I want, hate me all the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me and I don't give a fuck who don't

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Lock the CEO up, and I'm the CEO, fuck
Prison in February, and I ain't in no rush
Drink 'til I throw up, nigga, roll more blunts
Ball so hard, man, I gotta go pro once
Hit 'em with the shotgun, call that shit the stop button
Call me Doctor Carter, AKA ""Young Wild Nigga""
AKA ""No Trial Nigga"", AK click-clack, pow nigga
Fucking with the kid and you'll be missing like Bilal, nigga
Yeah! Swagger stupid, pack a Uzi
Hundred clips, nigga? That's a movie, aim at your toupee
You sweet as Kool-Aid, creme brulee
I'm sharp as Blu-ray, I fuck her today
Then she gotta skate — Young Lupe
I hit the beat hard — Bobby Boucher
I keep them tools on me, get the screwface
Flowers for the dead, here's a bouquet
L.V.'s, nigga, on every suitcase
Y.M., nigga, it's a new day
We the champions, nigga, hoo-ray
Yeah, hammer in the Louis duff
Take a nigga bitch, she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don't give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in the trunk and then the coupe sped up
Take the chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I'm Weezy F and the 'F' is for Flame
Eat these rappers, chef of the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat, the beat was slain
Rest in peace, that's a shame, he kill anybody's song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman's dome
No homo, you rockin' wrong, rest in peace my styrofoam
Now they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
Big money, my pockets long
New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back, pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese; cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby, but I'm in my I-don't-wanna-be-bothered zone
Yeah, you're a groupie, get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that ""Two-face""
Bitch I'm too great, take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Ain't no nigga like me
""What's up"" to my gang, big B's like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch, she ride my dick like she cycling
Then she can't walk, run, or jump, like white men
Fuck you niggas wanna do?
No Ceilings, let the bullets rain on you
Weezy F, the 'F' is for ""Fuck what you’re goin' through""
Make your people mourn you

[Verse]
I play the bullshit from the backseat, champ
Yeah, I'm in the backseat, still got the seat back
Feet back, stay from where the fake be at
Niggas snitch for the shine, where the patience at?
Nigga make his own brother face his back
Give love and take it back
Good grief! Man, this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack; you know the story—snakes eat rats
Face the facts: you can't change him
Can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him; if he kill you, then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him
Get too deep up in that water, and they can't save you
Me, I come out of that water like I was just bathing
And watch my step on the wet pavement, yeah
I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take em
""Hollygrove, Hollygrove"" was his last statement
So nigga, get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me W-E-E-crooked letter-Y, I'm so high
I skeet-skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine
Streetsweeper in the back of the hatch, make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in your speakers from the chopper blast
Like... Hahaha!
That's bullet holes in your sneaker,s got you hopping back
It all stop when they hit you in your top and back
No cocking back, silly motherfucker, you ain't heard 'bout this
The clips hang down to the dick
That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
When I hit every piece of your visible body, he leaking!
Mortimer is no longer leaping—he's sleeping
While you pussy niggas is sleeping, I'm thinking
Deep in thought, the boy ain't even winking
Bob Marley got me stinking
Stacking figures, I'm standing firm; life's a Slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins
From where I came, though I bear a name only one can live with
Coach, they won't knock me off my pivot, forget it
I'm sicker with it; pick a city, buy a condo
Find a fine ho, let some time go—chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo about dough? Nothing!
Man, the four-wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank top, pocket fan
No pocketknife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat-tat, tat-tat-tat, t-tat-tat, BOOM!
Haha! Tonight, I might...
Just boost my feature price
'Cause to each his own, and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house, big momma's house
She told me to shoot you right after I knock you out
And he ain't getting up after them shots
If you hit him in the right spot
Hold up... the beat might drop

I say: ""Look coach they pitching at me under hand""
But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya'll men designing women, I'm a woman's man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band, and
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'm a major set back when my album drop
I got that wet crack flow out ya mami's pot
I got that jet black four at ya mami's spot
I'm trying to get back door I demand it now
Yeah, panic now, you better pan it down
'Fore the neighbors they overhear me tear it down
Yeah it's Weezy F. Baby and his crown, the prince

[Hook - Reel]
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

[Verse 2]
And the hand gun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya ho I don't want your contusions
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It's money over bitches that I am going to keep proving
It's Weezy F, I got ya momma groovin'
Out of all the Hot Boyz she say I'm the coolest
I bought my bag of oranges its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm trying to seduce it
I floss, a awful lot of haters try and reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyeing you stupid
One shot to remind you who is
That fly little nigga that's behind the trigger, Wizzle
I'm off chronic combined with liquor
But niggas'll never see me like Momma Tigger
A 80's-baby a fighting nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I'm something you call pepper like a Viking slick
See me over the viking stove I'm whitening bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out untightening clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting a spliff
I do this you catching my drift
Representing with my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So roll the carpet out cause you fucking with a nigga from the royal South
See you either in or you out and if you out stay in cause them warriors out
Those vultures, them cops, and the lawyers out
I just open up the gate and let my hoyas out
No nigga I never call your house I'm probably somewhere taking Toya out
Not answering my phone, man, ignoring ya spouse
She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name naw better yet point him out
Hey, me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talking sweet I get them cavities out
I got graveyard fliers man I'm passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now I am the prince",Lil Wayne,On My Own,Reel
"[Verse 1]
Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Weez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicodins, Valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'mma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

[Chorus]
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

[Verse 2]
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Weezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', ""Stop!""
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than ""The Three Lil Pigs'"" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Weezy Wee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

[Chorus]
Tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

[Verse 3]
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'mma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

[Chorus]
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes

"[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]

Starin' at big poster I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin' back

And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?

Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

I don't know who you are anymore

I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""
She said...

And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

[Outro]
She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore

We are not the same, I am a Martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain like I bought it from Target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists
I'm starving, sorry, I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning

We are not the same, I am a alien
Like Gonzales, young college
Student, who done just flipped the game like Houston
I'm used to promethazine in two cups, I'm screwed up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts, you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up

They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare, like Mr. Clean with hair
No brake lights on my car rear
I never had life and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I meant others
I just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

Yesterday I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there
She wasn't there again today
I really hope she go away

Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch! I Kix it

She tryna put this money in her stocking
She kinda thick as fuck and got some knockers, woah
My niggas really Blood, and you just spotting whoa
We all over the bread like a Sloppy Joe
And when I'm in the pussy I'm a boss, knock her off
My enemy don't cross the line I draw, respect my art
Man I swear to God, these pussies soft like a moth
Weezy baby, diaper off, different cloth, different thoughts
Sippin' syrup like it's broth, life is short
Tart, fuck his bitch, whip his kids, drive his car
I'm grindin', tryna stack a hundred commas
Just popped a combo, I ain't talkin' bout McDonald's, woah

I'm standin' at a table full of choppas
I'm standin' in the Maybach cause it's topless

And we ain't got no traitors in our posse
And really I'm just wavy and I'm saucy
And really I'm amazing and I'm awesome
My whole squad lit, nigga, arson
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly nigga
If you ain't been to Vegas, you ain't party nigga
Shout out to Lil Capito and Marley nigga
I've been fuckin' with them since Atari, nigga
And me, I'm a lil 504 New Orleans nigga
I be in 305 though like a Marlin, nigga
And Hoody, he from Texas, bitches boppin', mane
And since I met him, I ain't ran out of drank, whoa!

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
When we leave H-Town, it's in a fish tank
Glass house Chevrolet, you can see everything
Bad bitches with cocaine nose rings
Give it up to real niggas and expose lames
Cold game, got me in the Mulsanne
Killin' these streets, audio drug slang
If you don't collect Ferraris, you ain't poppin' nigga
You could learn Italian in my driveway, bitches
If it ain't OG I ain't coppin'
Don't smoke, we just throw it in the garbage
Them niggas ain't tough, they just talkin'
Outchea after dark, them niggas targets
Horror movie writer, I be with the monstas
Trill surround us, you might not make it out 'em
Phone calls in the morning say they found him
Whole hood wanna see what y'all gon' do about it
Rolled up on the front porch at my grandma's house
Watchin' Blood Sport through the screen door
What you know about gunshots? Ever seen war?
I've really seen more than I talk 'bout, nigga
Stuntin' on streets you're scared to drive down
Our town, children be firin' live rounds
Hug the ground cause the shit gettin' serious
Fuck around, get killed unintentional
While I'm outchea eatin', nigga, Whole Foods
Rollin' up straight gas, fresh produce
I'm the guy that you go to, criminal smooth
Digital moves, triple the loot
Hopped on the phone, called the lot, ""Gimme the coupe""
I thought of Tune, called back, told him, ""Give me two""
That's what I do

When it comes to the bread, I got the keys to the bakery
These niggas out here trippin, sellin ki's to them agencies
My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me
I tell the silly bitch and ya honor, they can wait for me
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasing me
Shine so hard like the fucking sun facing me, basically
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me
Loving me but hating me, ho you got to pay for me

One night I was so high I thought that I forgot how to read
Young Money flyboys, mami, weed a different breed
Throwing parties at secret locations somewhere on the beach

I be in A-Town, livin' la vida la loca
Throwin that money on chichas, spendin' a stack up in Strokers
Yes I'm an animal, to be frank I'm a dog
If it's that time of the month, baby girl I need some skull
Some mouth and lip service, that'd be perfect
You saw the rims on the Benz and you got nervous
But I'm a G, yep, I pop my collar, hop in Impalas

I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked

It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge

Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills, for reals
I’m sorry if you hate you, and I’m sorry for the wait, too

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Boom – It’s my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don’t trust me
Big dog in this shit, like a Husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, ""Big bruh""
You a bad bitch always saying, ""Big Daddy""
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say, ""Let’s work,"" he say, ""Let’s work""
Let your next work be your best work

And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I’m so sorry for the wait, too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view, so I can see
How niggas went wrong and how the players was wrong
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is waiting
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick
Drop back like an all-star QB
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories
Like I do, and every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic-killer and talk calm to 'em
""Good day officer, what's the problem?""
You looking for answers? I don't got none
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga

Haha, I know that's right
Hello world, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, Music to Fly To coming soon, y'all

You can see me on the Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world, make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some Special Ed. shit
The magnificent, twist it like a dread, bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record is a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master

Oh yes I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description?
Her body's sickenin'
I can be her prescription
I can be her physician
Sexual healing
I can be her religion
And now she's kneeling
Praying to the ceiling
I bless her
As if she sneezed
Must be the weather
I dress her
I am her sleeves
I am her feathers
She's fly, flyer than you
Flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three –
Times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should
We should
Be wherever she wanna be
On a late night, midday, A,M
Just say when
And I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's Poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear me
But she does
We does
What grown folk do
When they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had to much to drink, and

Oh yes, I love her like I oughta
I see you at the altar
Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son
More than one
Maybe Five, like the Jacksons
Or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion
And daddy will be home
Later on
Smellin' like the cologne
That I put on
This morn'
And I hope
That you smell like woman's soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal
Yes, I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweatin' out a fever
Wow
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated
Panties are debated
Einstein; her head is the greatest

Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man
Would ever love her
Oh, and
I better be the only man
Stickin' it
Lickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them Orient Asians
I do me
I say, ""Hey Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty
Roll, like sushi""
I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
""Ahs"", ""Ooh-wees""
""Voilas"", ""Tah-das""
""Mhmms"", ""Uhh-huhs""
""Oh-yeahs"", never ""Oh-nos""

Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove, seventeen, danger zone
So many C-notes, I can sing a song

OK, I'm not a rookie, I'm a pro — methazine fiend
Make the homies say ho, and make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian, man, I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carats, and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag
Just some Swishers and a whole bunch of cans of whoop-ass, ha
I'm strapped, like a bookbag

Six feet deep, and until that day

Get money like Donald Trump, double-barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump, get stupid and get stomped
Two guns, I call 'em Kriss Kross, Kriss Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons, I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool, I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move, G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high I swear to God I went to the moon
I'm on that shit you can't get nowhere
You pussy boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball, no hair
Smoking on that ""Oh yeah,"" my niggas tote that hardware
What you 'bout, whoadie? My niggas 'bout that warfare
Real nigga since day one 'cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me, bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Droptop Maybach on the way, yeah, that's that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle, I'm gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty-cake, Blood gang red bandana face
Make them pussies pop they self, you can call that ""masturbate""
I don't front, don't fabricate, I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F. Baby, bitch, the ""F"" is for Fascinate
Louisiana, I'm from that swamp, I'ma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump, fuck you and where you from
Three, Two, I am the One, job well done
I ball 24/7, 3-6-5, twelve months
What's up Redbone? What's up Caramel?
Come to Wayne's World, it's a fairy tale
Yeah I'm high, bitch; bitch, I parasail

"[Verse 1]
What?
What?!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bad bowls
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?

[Chorus]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Verse 2]
Look
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'mma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Weezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me unattatched without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
Who? Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga

[Chorus]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Verse 3]
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Weezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who want this Weezy, nigga? Who want this Weezy, nigga?
Weezy, nigga; Lil Weezy, nigga

[Chorus]
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

Bandana 'round my braids
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggas play, they get drenched
My pockets is full of lint
So, nigga, stay off the bend, I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed

And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch, that pussy feel just like heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt, RIP — Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up, every night I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here nigga, fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!

"[Intro]
Ahem, Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

[Verse 1]
You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it I'mma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas
And fuck your hospital, Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like c-y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang

[Hook]
And you know that I’m gon' ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gonna be in it
The sky is the limit

[Verse 2]
Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is ""Eat""
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my Prps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours

[Hook]
And I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

[Verse 3]
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa
(That's fucked up, haha)
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
(Hah, now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the street

[Hook]
So you know that I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

[Outro]
Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit",Lil Wayne,Ride for My Niggas,

I won't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider
And you don't wanna fuck with me, ha
But I bet she gon' wanna fuck with me
Cause who wouldn't wanna fuck with me
Now I can't tell you shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothin' on me
So baby, you should bury him
And just marry me, just marry me

[Verse 1]
Ok, I'm looking for a redbone
And when I get her, I'mma tap it like a fed-phone
And shorty talk about her man, she said she tired of him
I said, well baby I'mma have you tryin' to hide from him
And if its Weezy then the women wanna lie to him
And I'mma give it to em, mama said give it to em
So I'mma give it to her just the way she want it
I said girl I'm tryin to put my name on it
I'm tryin to own it
Welcome to my ranch, and I'mma act a donkey
From the mornin, to the night, to the mornin
And if you back it up, then I'mma jump on it

[Hook 2]
I said I won't deny her
Shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my Bride to be
I take one knee
Let me take one knee
And I said, baby will you marry me
We live ever after happily
Just the way it's supposed to be
Just you and me
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Haa
Yeah shorty said she want a rider
And I could be that image, more like a provider
I can provide her
And if you lookin for me I'm probably inside her
You only like her
I'm tryin to wife her
See I'm a lighter, and she's my fire
See we are tighter than grip pliers
She gets me higher, higher than my purp
Shortie's so bright when you look at her make your eyes hurt
Better get a visor
Oh yeah shes cold yeah shes cooler than an iceberg
Fuck what you might heard
You only like her, I'm tryin to wife her

[Hook]
And I said I won't deny her, shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my Bride to be

Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Slide out the Ferrari, I came to wet up the party
And baby I can shoot like Robert Horry or Corey Maggette
Ready for the impossible, I'm colossal, fool
And y'all niggas just molecules
Don't know how to build a house but I got a box of tools
I'm talkin' 'bout that ""pop pop, pap pap, bang bang, blocka boom
That is for Tune
The coupe I'm in say ""va va voom"", then it go pe'hune
Nigga I'm gone
I'll see you soon, on the moon
Put me in the dirt and watch me bloom
Put me in the jungle, bet I'm coming back with all the food
Put me in the streets and bet I'm coming back with money
Yeah, bitch nigga run it (3x)
I'm heavily blunted, me and my gun loaded
She ridin' with me 'til the muthafuckin' road end
Yeah, and it be like that
I don't got papers on that Glock
But I got papers on that Mack

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Raw Dizzy]

I ain't have a body on it, but don't nobody own it
So anybody can get it if anybody wants it
Homie, I'm not your homie
You fuck around and end up wrapped up
In the trunk like a fucking mummy
Phony, I'm far from phony
I'm only about my money
And I keep enough of work to feed a thousand junkies
I stay strapped cause I keep a couple thousand on me
And I know these little cronies that's plottin' on me
But I ain't never scared
I ain't never runnin'
I got my own back
I ain't never frontin'
And I'm forever thuggin'
I'm like a pair of somethin' (?)
No heart, I don't care for nothin'
And no sir, I ain't here for nothin'
Then I'm trying to bring it back like the record's jumpin'
I got my system pumpin'
And I'm riding with the Mack and the duct tape in case I gotta carry somethin'

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]

I got real fucking blood flowing through my pulmonary veins
I play the kitchen, call me ""Culinary Maine""
Y'all niggas bitches, ya'll hustlin' on the scary train
While we move everything, from heroin to Mary Jane
But let me fall back, I know the Feds like rap
(There's an echo in the headphone)
That's how I know the mic tapped
When you don't brush your teeth
The only time you touch plaques
While we got too many on the wall
Yeah, it's like that
I got chicks that like me that don't like rap
Ask your girl who her favorite
I bet she say she like Mack
I tell a dark-skinned chick I'm allergic to chocolate
So if we eating use the plan and you can keep on walking
Hi Yellow Mamis, I don't eat red meat
I'm busy killing tracks
Yeah, this is a dead beat (rest in peace)
No child support
I pay with my heart, I kill it
I probably never be the best
But one of the realest

I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games

And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Look, I fucked the bitch with a broomstick
The same broom that I didn't clean my room with;
Yeah, I'm on her peach like a fruit fly
Last Night I bumped into God, I be Too High
Like 'excuse you', I said who are you?
He said ''I'm  the motherfuckin reason you are you''
Really? wow, You're the reason?
And all these time I thought it was Bitch ass Dwayne and Cita
Ehh, My Niggas nutty as a fruit pot
Shoulda Would Coulda mama should have got her tubes tied
The only job my bitch ever had is a boob job
Commit to the bitch? I'd rather commit suicide
I once knew a guy who knew a guy who had some weed
He turned out to be fruity, tried to suck my johnny apple seed
I ripped his fuckin heart out
And gave it to my girl on valentines day
And she still fuckin broke it
You hoe' bitch I hate you
Matter of fact, I love every bitch that hate you
I heard they kick you out of heaven for dyking with angels
Ughhhhh!, I said I'll never think about you again
And you gave me brains, You're playing mind games
I tattoo these tears cos you a crying shame
I know you fuck niggas who on my team like mama James
I fucked you raw and now a Nigga pissing fire rain
And now my dick mad at me, fuck!

And when my high came down, I burned his home down
I ain't on cloud nine, i'm on my own cloud
My friends are white, I might be hanging with the wrong crowd
Get it? hangin'?
Im titty-banging a bitch who still wear a training bras
I ate her fuckin heart out, It came with fries
And my soft drink, I dont blink, I see it all
My dick a ballerina, let me stick it in your Leotard
How the fuck these bitches gonna call me a dog?
Hold my dick above your head like a MVP award

And sure enough I got Ms. Cita in a better place

On the eastside we all blood, we all family, never Di-vide
Keep my knees high in my levi, Now, don't fuck up my de-sign
Yeah, I am big dog, big dog, barkin' at you felines
Yeah, you niggas is simple, what's a Bentley to a Nissan?

Yeah, go head, add another finger to the peace sign, that's the W and B sign, bitch


Yeah, ya' understands me, Mack they gonna' respect me

Fuck with me wrong, you’ll be waking up in his yard

Man, I act a ass, treat the beat like a hemorrhoid
Man, I go to work on the beat, call it employed
Man, I kicks it, bitch, get your shin guard

Perfection is the goal and I’m headed to the pylon
Crown fit me good, I ain’t even got to try on
The pistol mean business, that bitch should have a tie on
T done told me do this shit, so I had to do this shit

Keep it ""super"" for a while, let me get on my ""super"" shit

You won't be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib
Shoot you in the stomach now your pissin' out your ears

These niggas who snitching we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifying, you know that's as quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizing
You caught up too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie ""I know where to find him""

I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air, like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the building, we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cock eyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it gave me sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F-U, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the ""Whats"" with the ""Ifs""
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flying - colors
Light green teal turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Poppa was a rolling stone, worthless
Momma said I wasn't on, purpose
That's why I got a ice box where my heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, Grammies, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold blooded jouster, fighting for my life
Praying to the ring-side announcer

[Refrain]
It's so simple that it's complicated, yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit, tell 'em

[Chorus]
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Grave yard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

[Outro]
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper with me

T.I. and he is the king, bitch, don't get that shit twisted
And me, I am the best rapper alive, ladies and gentlemen, hello
This is Da Drought 3
And it's been a minute since I rapped on a Mannie Fresh beat
But uh, I guess I'll go ahead and show these niggas
What to do with one of the beats, mane... listen

[Verse]
I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked
Ridin' with a bad ho, with her girlfriend in the back
I like to get real high and I never look back
And you don't wanna try me, and don't I look strapped?
I come from the hardest city, ain't nobody fuckin' with it
Got a black-and-gold soul, with a fresh New Orleans fitted
And a collared polo and a pair of Bally Bucks
Young Money, motherfucker, know you worried 'bout us
Cash Money, motherfucker, CMR I trust
Never had my jaw broken, but his jaw I bust
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus
What happens on my bus, stays on my bus
And that white widow weed out the jar is a must
If you give me a cigar, then a cigar I'll bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff
Look ma, I'm tryna make a porno, starring us
Well not just us, a couple foreign sluts
Yeah, we make this some ménage à troisin', y'all in?
I be with Jim Jones and we be ballin', ballin'
Yeah, baby, we ballin', like Rawlins and Spalding
Pint of DJ Screw and that Hawaiian
I am leanin' like a 3 legged lion, climbing
Right to the top of the motherfuckin' mountain.. counting
I'm gonna need me an accountant to count it
Mannie got this fuckin' beat poundin', it's poundin'
But it was just lost, until I found it, I found it
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it
Put this bitch to sleep, fuckin' right, I night-gowned it
Niggas talkin cheap, tell them niggas, ""Pipe down, bitch!""
Bloods in the building, now everybody soundless
Beatin' up this track like a muthafuckin' round-fist
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'mma spit like a long kiss
I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this planet
I know, see I live by my only
Say, where my cheese, nigga? Where my macaroni?
Baby, I get up in dat ass, and act a donkey
Candy on candy, nigga grippin' the grain
See, I'm the only fire that can live in the rain
I am so so New Orleans, like 1825 Tulane

[Outro]
Hahaha.... see, you gotta be from New Orleans
To know what the fuck I'm talkin bout
And if you don't... fuck you
I say what I want, and I don't want nothin'
Cause I got everything, bitch",Lil Wayne,Seat Down Low,
"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She is so sick, and I would love to be her patient
And I will work every day as long as she's my occupation
Be, be, don't you wanna be
Be my secretary, she's my secretary
He's just secondary, we do what we wanna
He don't have the slightest
He thinks she's the nicest
I think she's so nasty
We do it so often
It seems like a job now
Like a nine to five now

Don't you wanna be (don't you wanna be)
Be my secretary (be my secretary)
Come and work for me (come and work for me)
Whatever's necessary (whatever's necessary)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
She's my employee of the month
Because of her I never learned how to role a blunt
She do everything for me, roll magazine for me
Shawty act like she gotta run away from him for me
Wayne, lemme quit talkin' and watch where I'm walkin'
I don't wanna step on toes, 'cause her homey gettin' angry
Overtime at the job is keepin' his girl from home
Nine to five or regular hours, but her shift's six to ten
She goes home at ten to be happy with her man
Till I need her too clock back in

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
You can check her resume and see what you will find
She has never missed a day and she has always been on time
When he's not in, that's when she clocks in
And if the bible says it's wrong, God don't forgive us for our sins

It's all about the Young fuckin' Money
It's a war in these streets, I need a Humvee
That AK-47, that's my trusty
Got some tricks up my sleeves, I need some cufflinks
Oh Lord, these niggas soft, these niggas fluffy
Another one bites the dust 'til his gums bleed
Oh Lord, Public Enemy, Chuck D
Me with no money's like a bunny with no front teeth
Fuck me? It's fuck you if it's fuck me
I hit the kush, blow it out like a bum knee
Where the haters? Point 'em out and ask 'em what's beef
Stack of hundred dollar bills in a scrunchie
Oh Lord, kamikaze, kidnappin' killers
Screaming ""Fuck the other side!""
She ride the dick, the dick gon' kill her, vehicular homicide
Oh Lord, I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
I'm sorry for them other guys
Lay a nigga down, Nina sang his ass a lullaby
Wave your white flag all you want, bitch, I'm colorblind
Bad bitch with me got thunder thighs and her mother's eyes
Li-li-li-lick my lollipop like it got gum inside
Miami in the winter, Cali in the summertime
My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime
Love it when we makin' love, hate it when it's fuckin' time
Disrespect the caterpillar, rave about the butterfly
Bullet ain't got no name, nigga, but you could get it customized
Run up in your house, undisguised, why you look surprised?
Motherfuckers better fuckin' hide, I feel like Mr. Hyde
Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires
Oh Lord, one of the wildest B's in my hive
I'll sting a bitch and die anytime
Hate it when the fuckin' police shut the session down
We just talkin', we just skatin', we just messin' round
Tell them niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round
They just barkin', they just fakin', they gon' settle down
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape
Nigga came on your bitch, ooh milkshake
Chop a cocaine brick like a sensei
Break the great white down to a fish plate

Real nigga like a motherfuckin' slave

And everybody's on edge until you push 'em
Haha, but the pleasure's all mine
'Cause on my watch I'm the greatest of all time

Bark up my tree, that's a dead dog
Where them hoes at? Tell 'em I said ""what's up?!""
I like a shaved pussy, no razor bumps
I got that paper bitch, come get a paper cut
Don't gamble in that pussy not even lady lucks

When life hands you lemons find the limelight
Yea, and the pleasure's all mine

On the road to riches, you niggas stuck in traffic
Stomp a nigga out, keep the party goin'
Kick them hoes out if them hoes annoyin'
But if they friends bad then them hoes could join
I'm bout to shoot a porn I'm castin' broken arm
Got money on my mind, pussy on my agenda
I beat that pink pussy magenta fuck bein' gentle
Man I'm hard, these niggas is simple gun to your temple
I smoke 'til I look oriental high as a window
And I broke these niggas like pencils unaccidental

I heard some shouts, like, ""Down on the floor!"" (bow!)
Then—even louder—""We got shooters (yeah), shooters! (yeah)""

Shotgun watches door, got security good (check!)
Jumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink
He tell her, ""I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter"" (let's go!)

If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

Take pain like Tylenols, raw, way past par

My reply was simply, ""Pow!"" C'mon!

I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch
Behind orange juice and grits

I need another Uzi clip
I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real
Your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest
But her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter 5
On a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said ""Soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back""
I said ""You too cray""
She said ""You too humble""
I said ""You too, bae""
She said ""You too sweet""
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say ""They do say love is a two-way street""
I say ""Oooh""

Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum

Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees

Sell birds to the bees
I sell birds to the trees

I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace

I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like ""Tunechi, you good?""
I'm like ""Bob, yessiree!""
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
'Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
""You only live twice, slime""
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine

My squad poppin', my bitch shoppin'
My niggas thuggin', my bitch robbin'
I'm inside cuddlin' with the chopper
Workin' on the stove, like a novel
Diggin' in my pockets, tryna find the bottom
Codeine got the drink all soggy
And your queen got my dick hard body
There's a stick up in my drawers, armed robbery
My squad poppin' like the white house
Squad never need time out
Squad way up on the ninth cloud
Way up here we got iCloud
My squad lit like a strobe light
Every night, any night, all night
6 hoes and they all dykes
And all they need is one mic
My new attic full of dead bodies
Old attic full of dead bodies
Bedroom full of red bodies
I got your main bitch headlinin'
She cry to me, said ""You're no fair""
Cried to me, said ""You're low fare""

So we showered together and the soap fell
Then I ask her how the dope feel
I don't care how the ho feel
I kick her ass out the dope house
And she can ask her ass how the door feel

Had to hide my guns 'cause they gun-shy

Had to put a few killers on

You gon' have to put some antennas on

Bitch bounce like a tennis ball
Pussies hatin' like menopause
Its a jungle out there, Senegal
Wait, drop-top with the tinteds on

I'm gon' fuck her hard 'til her sternum gone
My diamonds sing, she learn the songs

Alright, let’s put it in perspective
See 1, 1 makes you realize

Some of you niggas mad the sport normally happens to be skateboarding
But that gives us 4 wheels to roll over you niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She’s so sophisticated
She'll catch a nigga nut and then refrigerate it
I wear a rubber and we fuck 'til we dehydrated
I pull it out bust on her face and call her cry baby
I kiss her neck, I kiss her stomach, then I kiss that pussy
And then I eat it from the back, but I don’t do crack
And then I get this monster hard and ask her where to put it
She tell me, Tunechi, hit it raw, I tell her bitch you crazy
Don’t want no HIV, don’t need that Honeymoon In Vegas
It’s YMCMB the fucking alpha and omega
The presidential double R, call that Ronald Reagan
I fuck your bitch, we come together call that congregating
I be balling on these niggas, Sports Illustrated
Tough in the streets, but you in the court with a statement
Ain’t that a bitch and I kill everybody but the babies
Give that bitch nigga the blues 'til he fucking navy
Yeah, man I be riding round with that yopper
I pop a nigga like [clap noise]
All you hoes get topless, suck this dick 'til it’s spotless
Too many hoes: I got options
I ain’t never tripping, you could have the bitch
And I’ma send her back with her pussy lips, looking just like camel lips
You fucking with some real nigga, blow your fucking head off
They say life is a bitch, I hope that bitch a redbone
All I know is get money, bitch ain’t getting shit from me
Fuck a six pack, six bullets give you six stomachs
Tell her how that pussy tastes, she been eating pineapples
Throw her back like a quarterback, hit that ass like a linebacker
Put that pussy on me, we caught up in the moment
AK with a hair trigger, nigga don’t make me comb it
This like a full time job not to kill niggas
Some of my homeboys' job is to kill niggas
Yeah, cause I’m still on probation

"[Hook]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

[Verse 1]
Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!

[Hook]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

[Verse 2]
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

[Hook]
You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty

[Verse 3]
But I hope you haven't forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""butter,"" I called you ""babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

Ain’t nobody fucking with me
First degree murder, you can get your degree, motherfucker
And you ain’t gotta wonder about me, Wonder Woman
Tune gonna ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gonna hate
Pound of the kush, call that bitch ""pound cake""
I hit it from the back and make that bitch about face
And then I gotta split, sorry baby, sour grapes
She whine, baby don't leave
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody trippin', but I ain’t never trippin'
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talking 'bout money and the power, power and the money
This shit is magic: Stan Van Gundy
I'mma run this shit 'til I'm the last man runnin
Mack light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money motherfucker yeah we that shit
Yeah Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X, I smoke O’s, tic-tac-toe
And I stink cause I got a lot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie, is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand in front of the clock cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your Mom
I ain’t playing with niggas, no sir not me
And they can’t blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you Wayne?
I’m somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now ain’t that about a bitch? It ain’t never about a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some knee pads nigga
Eagle street where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til Kingdom come
Yeah Short brang the drank, I bring the blunts
Fucking with me its blood, brains or guts
Fuck y'all, for real, though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done peel off like velcro
Gone, baby I'm stoned
Smoking on the strong, got a huge ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
One time for the G’s
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s
Put your bitch ass on the evening news
Jumping in the game better read the rules

[Verse 1]
What ya Mami told ya bout fuckin round wit' them soldiers?
Told ya I'd be back, I'm comin', I got that Tommy Lasorda
That's blood all over ya sofas, blood all over ya posters
Blood all over ya shoulders, blood all over the strollers
Do that shit, I done that shit, it's Weezy Baby, he's a baby
But that nigga run that shit, make that money come back quick
Take that money from that bitch, she know what it be, M.O.B
Pistol right there in my reach, you know what it be, him or me
Bitches know when that limo leave, two words: room key
Where? Penthouse suite, wear not-a-damn-thing
I'm here, bada-bam-bing, my hand bling, my wrist bling
My neck bling, my ear bling, Super bowl ring, bitch
Cash Money, Young Money, Super Bowl team, bitch
Money, money, money, money: I'm true to those things, bitch
You with those pussy hoes, I shoot at those queens, bitch
This is New Orleans, bitch, murder dope fiend shit

[Verse 2]
What ya Papi told ya bout fuckin round with them soldiers?
I told ya, I'm comin back, I got that Tommy Mottola
That's blood all over ya Rover, blood all over ya chauffeur
Blood all over ya loafers, if I get any closer
There's blood all over my toaster, blood all over my holster
I'm in them S. Dots, that's blood all over my Hovas, fuck
I'm hustlin' with a motive, my niggas need me
And that Tiger in my pocket say, ""Feed me,"" it's greedy
See 'em niggas, jack 'em niggas, kill 'em niggas, whack 'em niggas
Ask 'em bitches, ask them niggas, Weezy baby, that's the nigga
Catch me mashing in a V, matching seats, matching feet
Sheesh, that bitch too sweet for the streets
Got that keef for the leaf if he finna beef, no need to speak, let it be what it be
Niggas want peace, I make 'em leave here, piece by piece
Fuck me? Fuck you! What it is? What it do?
I been ready since '81 and I was born in '82
Hollygrove where I'm from, but we call that bitch the Zoo
I ain't never trust a bitch since she ate that forbidden fruit
Sucker free, sucker proof, 50 shots, cut 'em loose
Quarterback Weezy, baby, shotgun, run and shoot
Coming through, young'n do what young'ns do, ball, baby

She gave me relations, so now, we related
The morning comes; the picture, faded
I waited on my turn to burn, can I get a light?
Little dog, bigger bite, Jackson Five, Little Mike
Can I get a mic or a mic and a half

And if you stand over my body, I'll probably kill ya, yeah
Now I feel it, Weezy the realest

Brains came out his fucking ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'mma keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'mma flunk
Tell my bitch I could do bad on my own
She say ""You gon' miss me nigga."" I say ""Bitch the thrill is gone""
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
I fuck her 'til she cry, make that ho drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hanging out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes getting mashed
Run up in the kitchen get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? stop talking while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothing like some pussy when you going through something
Just called a bad bitch, I said I'm going through something
Bugatti sitting still, look like it's going 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions
Mother fucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
And we only selling what the boat bring here nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fucking reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfucking Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here

I gotta clean up after these niggas 'cause they be wasting time
And boy, my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power, but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the Feds
You know snitches get stitches, nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all your possessions, call that shit Poltergeist
And my homie, he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plane Jane 'cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space, like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra
Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper, I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket, flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a uni-verse
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya, shout out Turk

I know that times changed, I don't think I've changed
I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games
Baby, stop playin' with me
Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me
Shit is so embarrassing, low-key flattering
They'd rather battle royale, way before they battle me
Long live my skateboard and rest in peace to Adam Z
Motherfucker, stop playin' with me

[Chorus]
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, it's been a long time
For a long time
Time sure flies but it's on a long flight
No I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well bitch, it's game time
And you gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I've been feelin' like a killer since the diapers
I've been feelin' like a hitter since the minors
Sticky icky like a itsy bitsy spider
They say to be or not to be, bitch, I'm indecisive
I'm in the buildin' like the interior designer
You in your feelings like a bitch when she get her cycle
Ain't that a bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm yellin', ""Please don't wife her""
Dwayne Carter, niggas wanna be the DC sniper
Well, fuck it, I'm thuggin' on the low, I'm ballin' on the high
I'm fuckin' on the floor, she can crawl but can't hide
I'm Bloodin' with my bros, goin' hard with my slimes
It ain't nothin' to a GOAT but the roar of a lion
Jungle book, ho, it's another book show
No car keys needed, button push, go
We gon' ghost ride in the whip, then she believe in ghosts
I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow
Put my foot down in this bitch, these niggas twinkle toes
Nigga, sit down, you a bitch, I heard your seat unfold
Way up in the nosebleeds, hold your head back, squeeze your nose

[Outro]
Nigga, stop playin' with me
Stop playing with me
It's been a long time, a long time
Long, long time since she loved me long time
Told her stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me
No, I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well then it's game time
You gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch
Yes, I've been on time, for a long time
And time sure flies, but it's on a long flight
And you gon' stop playin' with me, yeah",Lil Wayne,Stop Playin With Me,
"[Verse 1]
Straight from the East side
Blood gang, we heavy
Fuck nigga, dare me
I turn into Freddy
My fingers machetes
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis
We trap out the 'telly when we outta town
Uzi on deck
Phone ringin' off the hook
Bitch that's the plug
Ocean view bedroom baby
See through showers
And I just put some fish in my tub
Hold up, I ain't playin'
Niggas say they rich, I say ""And?""
Same old song, I ain't dance
Heater on my waist, hotter than a frying pan
If you don't see what I'm sayin'
I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam
I ain't playin'
Guns in my hands, I ain't prayin'
Fireman
Spittin' venom, Spiderman
I'm enhanced
I’m at peace, joggin' pants
Cost at least about a grand
I'm advanced like Japan
Got more sand than Sudan
Lord

[Bridge]
And life ain't nothin' but a long day
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way away
You know that haters come in all sizes, all shapes, 'kay
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space
Got insurance on the trap house, Allstate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a 808
Boom, like a 808

[Verse 2]
I could fly around that bitch, need a tarmac
I just landed in Cuba, need a straw hat
I gotta get the raw back, I need a format
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I'll turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts
Boy, I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack
Ooh, 187, 211
Hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter
Train smoker
Smoke plain, never
Had a date with the Devil
Then I changed schedules
I'm a trained killer
Like a paid killer
Better yet, Saddam Hussein nephew
Nigga, no love
That's from the bottom of my heart
I pull up and paint your whole fucking block red
Then get out of my car
And admire my art
Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a hawk
She see why I'm a boss
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti
While it was parked
Now I don't wan' talk, bitch I don't wan' talk
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar
Anybody want war?
I'm excited to start
Get indicted tomorrow
I be out by the morn
Before I even yawn
Stay in ya lane, I remind these lil boys
This is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won'ts
Lord, please
Kilos, OZs
'Cause my bitch high class
She like Pinot and cheese
I dropped out of class
So I'm zero degrees
I can out-think a shrink
She can deep throat a tree
I can hijack a Brinks
So my sweet soda pink
I'm a freak show to freaks
I'm spitting these bars
Hope my bar tab is cheap
I'm a hard man to reach
I'm newborn and deceased
I'm too hard for this beat
I'm the heart and the beat
The Chong and the Cheech
My blunt long as a speech
Roach look like a leech
I'm too long for the brief
I'm too wrong for the priest
With this chrome on your teeth
That get blown out your cheek
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet
I'm the head nigga, like Prodigy
And bitch I'mma shine, like Connery
Yeah

"[Verse 1]
Comin' home when your Daddy go to work
Three phones and my pagers go berzerk
I'm talkin' birds like Dooney and Bourke
I'm talkin' work, enough to make you a clerk
Rubber bands, hard plates (what else?) big spoons
That whip got the plug out in mid June
Early July, I'm early like the bird that fly
Even Martin got a piece of that pie
I Eddie Murphy laugh at nigga, throw that piece in the sky
Drop the top on the Mercy, and bench streets with my tires
Make it dance like Percy, kids they on the sidewalk
Used to stash weed in my momma's Buick Skylark
I talk only full prices, negotiation
Rumination, fuck the police station
And if you got any association, then murder all close relation
Street life

[Verse 2]
Grocery bags on the counter, no grocery store
Couldn't fit a half a mil in the Gucci tote
Hit the lights, watch the roaches say ""good night""
Stomp twice, say goodbye to the mice
Cook nice with a little bit of slice
And watch them dope fiends put that fire to that ice
Surely that dog's tail wag, it will bite
Man I'm just trynna get my scratch on these lice
When I was young, I had a flag on my bike
And then I went and got them mags on my bike
Momma don't wait up for me, I lost a bundle runnin' from the cops
Gotta get that makeup money, hey
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
It's Hollygrove till they bury me cold
Who's to say if they gon' bury me old?
I live that street life

[Verse 3]
Back to the struggle, born trouble
Like trynna find strength in a torn muscle
Young as scum, Daddy gone
But youngin' run the streets till he pull the gun
Pull they arm, all-all black hoodie on
Talibon strapped with the gat like a bomb
Red storm, handkerchief head on
Fuck around and them bees swarm, be calm
Better know what street you on
Don't you come on Eagle, are you Evel Knievel?
Crackheads got pipes and pistols
Now run up on that crackhead and fight the pistol
This is the street, nigga eat
Where the birds don't tweet, the birds go cheap
And niggas don't sleep, you may have heard of MLK
But I know a gang of niggas with they own street
Street life",Lil Wayne,Street Life,
"[Intro: Drake]
(Dramatic, nigga!)
Well, alright, here I go

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm a rapper turned singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords, all I hit is c-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fuckin' game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are post game
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's comin' too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, ""Yeah, once in a blue moon""
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'ns like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna to roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em ""Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it""
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
(Gangsta!) I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bumped
While you had a black president

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, p-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie's scared, cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm fallin', but up I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, ya'll order
Whatever y'all please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 Gs is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so bout it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant a casualty, oops, I meant catastrophe
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch (Gangsta!)

Kicking rocks on the block, telling all the OGs
""I be coming for your spot when you're not looking""
Hot cooking, mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights, but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke so
I had hope; you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only Hot Boy eating off this plate: Young
Weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon' be empty
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies, relocate
Y'all know us, when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon' never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon' try to manage
Niggas doing anything, like, God gon' understand 'em
But please understand this: niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families, lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like magic
Shit... Well, call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze:
Summer, please, know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I probably hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for you
Behind bars, tryna get to you, and probably never see you
This that real talk if ya ever heard it, homie
Shit hurts so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
No cut; tell life, ""So what?""
The drought's here; not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing 'cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world coming, and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster
This ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust ya head in the air, that's a skycap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause, I'm proceeding
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida

Listen, who kid? It's the new kid
The ber-berry boss, asterisk on the shoe, kid (Fly)
The Baltimore Buccaneer, the explorer
In Tom Ford linen and a crispy fedora
Caught throwin a tilt
Thought I was the man 'til I puff the open sex, her ass dropped on the silk
The nocturnal hustla, product of the evening
Gritty, runnin through New York City like the thieving
Time to up the ante
Pockets uncanny
Bulging Kim pussy pressed against the panty
Now I'm in Vermont, and done funny in Miami
Duckin rat packs like Sinatra and Sammy
Trust me, I've been underneath the tap
Doin time, pressin jeans underneath the mat
Waitin on feet up
Now I hate to speed up
My g, you wanna ride?
You gotta raise the front seat up

No one on the corner have swagger like us

(Verse 4, Twista)
T the best!
I styled it with that category
Others got a lot of stories
All these other rappers bore me
They say Twista, won't you take this to your laboratory
No ones in the category
Talk about your swagger for me
Nobody fuckin wit Twist'
I be havin to fill the irrelevant
And then I be killin 'em off with my ana'
It's like I'm a scorpion, like I'm an elephant
Fill 'em with venom and then I'mma stomp 'em into oblivion
Like I'm a million, like I'm a billion
Like I'm a trillion, I'm a gazillion, hey!
Hit 'em in the body with a millimeter then I gotta put 'em in the dirt
Put me in the middle of the money, cuz I know I gotta get it
So I know I gotta work
Grab them since '91, when I came at them differently
I am the first
They be comin and travelin with the dead bodies of rappers
And I am the hearse
Twiiiiistaaaa
I'mma get money killa, stay full of swagger
And that eat'cha beat'cha
Twiiiiistaaaa
I got that horror flow
Call it the creature feature

[Verse 1]
I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spazz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt, behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga, hold court in the streets
And convict this nigga, ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money mothafucka
You think we gon' do our thing? Well ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'mma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip, now it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuque roll them killer plants, the Lil Tune Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Tocara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mommas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdy these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers
Now get off my dick, I ain't fucking with ya
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good then her friend assist her
I mean the bitch she never met her best friend or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boy's memory now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But heaven or hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'mma go
Take a nigga's gal and make her come give me a private show
Still long hair, don't care like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse and I swag and surf
No ceilings",Lil Wayne,Swag Surf,
"[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I’ll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I’m going’ outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You’re the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, young money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave their body in a bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread (my youte)
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!
B- b- b- boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy mama you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badibadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, ""It's all yours!""
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Kush it out, red bone pussy mouth
Eat you up, spit you out
Fuck your girl in your house
I’m terrible be careful
You might want say a prayer or two
So cold I need theraflu
I'm so high I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked
Got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think your sweet as devils food
I never lose
My weapons use
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she’s the queen
Two’s a couple, three’s a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams
Get the pussy wet Abita springs, huh, Im Easter clean
Shout to my home girl Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem
You niggas gassed up ‘93 supreme

More than an artist bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit
And walk around like she President Carters bitch
She be on her Barbie shit

Wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, what

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight off the block, gold nuts in my hand, trustin' no man
Got my Glock cocked, runnin' this thing, ya understand
We be steamin', blazin', nines, pumps and K's and
Hollygrove 17th the hood where I was raised in (what, what, what)
Niggas bustin' heads and, runnin' duckin' Feds and (what)
Rocks under they tongues and, ki's under they beds and
Hood fulla real niggas, twenty-four seven hustlers
(Ughhh) Until we shove a barrel down ya pipe suckers
Ain't no love for no busta, no fear for no coward
No respect for no slut, and no money without power
We keepin' niggas hotter, ughhh, nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and ""blocka"" at every hour
Some niggas like that powder, foldin' up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins (oh)
From the home of that 'caine, jackin' and crackin' brains
Broadcastin' live from Tha Block, it's Lil' Wayne (who it is?)

[Chorus: Juvenile, (B.G.) & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (Well cook something, nigga)
Nigga, you let them K's go? (Well bust somethin, nigga)
Are you duckin' that law? (You better run from 'em, nigga)
Are you playin' with that raw? (Well won't you front somethin', nigga)
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
See where I'm from we keep our guns out
Dodgin' cops and burnin' blocks so we be thugged out
It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halfs and birds in that one house (I got it, I got it)
It's all good in the hood hustlin' like it's legal
Soon as you get it, hot (skrrt!) there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Ms. Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggas murder off top, boy
It's the spot where they got fire girls and hot boys
We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day 'til we ""400 Degreez""
And you see when it get dark, nobody be on the porch
They got a nigga got on a scarf, he flippin' out off that raw
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure (*beep beep*) your door is locked
'Cause this ain't nothin' proper, 'cause Tha Block issss hot

[Chorus: Juvenile, (B.G.) & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (Well cook something, nigga)
Nigga, you let them K's go? (Well bust somethin, nigga)

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
See watch your step on my set, gotta walk like, talk like
We done shot out all the street lights, so you can't see who we be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggas been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin' with cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hahhhh, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggas that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin' weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up, put em in the vans then put a gat in his jaws
One move blow his cactuses off

[Chorus: Juvenile, (B.G.) & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (Well cook something, nigga)
Nigga, you let them K's go? (Well bust somethin, nigga)
Are you duckin' that law? (You better run from 'em, nigga)

"[Verse 1]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

[Verse 2]
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's Glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

[Verse 3]
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Weezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip cause they breathe and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the Glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools

Cut the music up please

Yeah, I shall never leave Hip-Hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tick tock
Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord — I am God’s own

Tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool
Before that, it was a livin' cesspool
We gotta get on our shit, like gnats do
Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do
And in this game, nobody’s on my plateau
Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots

Alright; alright, alright, alright
I’m in their conversations
The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

Spendin' time backwards, hotter than a cactus

I load millions and more millions

Y'all niggas need a lesson on some ethic; you gon' learn now
I do this for the love of it; saliva, cause I love to spit
And I juke it; for my future records, y'all gon' love to spin
Fucking with my brethren, 10 years strong

You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch
I love my young bitch
'Cause she don't give me drama
You don't want no drama
My goons waitin' for you, to snap
Like some photo bombers
Yeah we leave a nigga flat
We leave 'em horizontal
And then my lawyer tell your honor
On that morning, I was –

[Chorus]
Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you girl
Yeah, I was chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you

Do I smell beef?

[Verse 2]
I was chilling on the corner about to get fucked up
My nigga T got a 40, and he brought two cups
That nigga Mack was chillin', Po was home talkin' on the phone
Lord, it's been such a good-year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hoody on the set, he got his hoodie on
Euro the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong, chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord, I know I do my thing, can’t let my thing do me
Lord, I know I ain’t a Saint, still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord, just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree, this murder in the first degree
I got that Tec under my arm like Right Guard, Sure, Degree
Lord, sometimes I just be so gone I be like ""Earth to me?""
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I served a fiend
While I was

[Chorus]
Chilling on the set
With a fully automatic Tec
I was thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you girl
Yeah I was chilling on the set
With a fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you, girl

[Outro]
Yeah
Thinking 'bout you girl
Working my juug girl
Still thinking 'bout you girl
Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
Working my juug girl
I was still thinking 'bout you",Lil Wayne,Thinking Bout You,

Miss Butter pecan caramel southern bell
She hotter than a summer day in hell
I'm under her spell, she say her name is Chantel
She say she got a man, I can't tell
Because when we be rockin'
We get it poppin like a Amstel, like
Right up in the hotel, maybe the stairwell
She blows kisses to my handheld
She an angel her name should be An-gel ' I'm Blessed '
I kill her wit the rich man smell
She got a wet manhole and ya mans fell whoa
I slipped in her inkwell
I saw jelly fishes seashells, no further details
I love the smell of a female
And you're one hell of a female I'm tellin' ya female
Get in the CL and let it be sweet sailin' and late night e-mailin'
Ooh she feel me, Ooh Fee Fee I think she feels me

[Verse 2]
Okay, I called her on a late night it was late right
I was on her ass like some brakelights
But I ain't stop for the redlights
We get it poppin' til the blue and red lights come knockin'
Neighbors keep trippin, we keep fuckin
Sex revolution, baby I'm comin
Down the hallway that lead to your stomach,mami
I'mma keep pumpin till you scream Young Money
And me and you're boyfriend is not the same
I goes down like the stock exchange, and the I bring it up
'Scuse me, I drink it up, I leave you soakin' wet from ya ankle up

Big shotties in the closet, that's all I wore
Screaming ""money over power,"" quote, un-quote
And if the bread get too low, kidnap John Doe (Hold up)

I just fucked your bitch in some Young Money flip flops
I'm smoking on that loud and you can hear a pin drop (Hold up)
I just kissed my bitch and I left codeine in her mouth (Yeah)
Swimming in my money, I smell chlorine when I count (Get 'em)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Skating and mating, I'm spinning like Daytons
I'm winning like Peyton, I'm Christian like Laettner
I'm putting some straightener into all of these Satans
I'm wilder than Nathan, Goliath on David
I'm quietly waiting, I'm trying to be patient
But they want me to wait for Simon to say it
But I am too faded, so talk to my agent
Or they talk about you to your congregation
Man, no conversation or negotiation
No affiliation by association
I need confirmation for my compensation
Or we make a corpse out of your corporation
I need my donation, take drugs in rotation
That AK gon' sound like a standing ovation
They landing your facial, bandanna, rosacea
I'm all about numbers, comparisons, ratios
Collateral, collateral
Xanax and Adderall got me unparalleled
Me and your bitch compatible
Go together like a parachute and a ""geronimo""
This dick is mechanical
But he get too casual up in the vaginal
I pop a Viag-a-ra, she hop like a kangaroo
Suck like a snaggle-tooth
I ain't got time for no rumors
When I am not human, or you men, I'm booming
I'm fucking her, fucking her roomie
I'm platinum versus aluminum, I'm shrooming
I visualize what I'm assuming, my vision is gloomy
But fuck it, I zoom in and now I see movement
And I'd like to thank all the niggas that schooled me
But I still might shoot up my class reunion
I'm sipping that Houston like it's communion
Smoking some weed, bright as a petunia
I'm walking around Miss America
Like I'm the King, King of Zamunda
Been hanging around with my shooters
When you was still hanging out with Mr. Cooper
Which one of you niggas want beef?
I'm putting your name all inside the chalupa
Money since the Mayans, thuggin' since the riots
Six, exemplifyin', higher than Orion
Lion off the diet, eat the whole safari
Pop a cork or body, keep it soft and sour
Watch the market tower
Find a wooden counter, knock on it twice and count 'em
Competition, clown 'em, opposition chowder
Watch the bitches shower, optimistic mama
Common sense ain't common, top position scholar
So far from the bottom, they can't hear me holler
All I say is our, all I say is our, our father
My lil' bae a model, pussy taste like cobbler
Make me ""As-salamu alaykum"" about her
What more can I say about her? Pray about it
I just race the 'Rari, left it way behind me, taste the mileage
Loud-ass blatant diamonds, I think they the loudest
Waking zombies
Break a face or promise, give me steak lasagna, hate your honor
Still my mama's baby; and my baby mamas, they some riders
Can't deflate them tires, I'm still chasing commas
Nigga I made Big Tymers
And I'm still taking time to make it timeless
Dedication problems
Sick shit, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Skit: Lil Wayne]
The nicest thing a fan can say to me when they approach me on the street is any fucking thing true, anything real. You know what I mean, that's the nicest thing. I mean like, even if its cliché, cliché I can still tell when that cliché was straight from your heart and that's all you could think about, all you could think to say when you saw me or if you meant it, like even if it's that, like I said just when it's real. You know why? 'Cause sometimes people can say things that's so real to them that they don't even know that, you know what I mean, some of the things they are saying isn't fact, you know what I mean, official. But you know, things like so what I mean like example: you might walk up on somebody, I might walk up on somebody on the street and they might, uh, they might... shout out the valet from today, umm well yesterday, shout out the valet from yesterday, before you opened the door of my car, you're looking in my eyes, you're a young cat too, you look me in the eyes and you say ahh, and he couldn't, his English wasn't all that, he said: I like the new album, I really like the new project, and I said to him I was like thank you man, he meant that, 'cause he looked me in my eyes and he even opened my door before he said it, you know what I mean, so I was like damn you know when I got in the car I was like damn it's not a project. You know what I mean I don't even consider that, it's damn sure not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie.

Now I got two large accounts
Where money stacks in large amounts

Let that chopper start to sing and let it ring and then I’m out

I bought her cell phone and I don’t even much call it
New imports make her feel important
No bullshit, nigga, no Ben Gordon
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I can't wait til she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the vet cause she a bad bitch
You can't be broke and happy, so me, I'm madd rich

I speak a little French and her's is no better then mine
I pass her the blunt, she probably hit it one time

We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shorty, you gonna have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out

We are at war with the universe
The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da, ooohh
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything? But I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?

Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success, and you're next
So try, they can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know

Yeah, yeah, yeah
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart

Yeah, born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee

Grrr

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I did not come here to see who was litty
That stamp on the kilos say ""key to the city""
Put some on my thumb and then I make her lick it
She can't feel her tongue, well, bitch, I beg to differ
I smoke gasoline and I sip down some lean
My whole tangerine on this dick, trampoline
I chop you up, they call them amputees
I spit these facts, they call me fax machine

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I drop a four in this, I'm feelin' glorious
Gun on Big Pun, and my clip on Notorious
Bitch, I'm the man, no, the Mandalorian
I'm in a DeLorean, nigga, I'm floorin' it
I got my whore in it, that bitch a foreigner
Pourin' her heart out, I'm just ignorin' her
I let my hair down, I'm finna go throw her
And bury myself in that pussy, no coroner
I can't smoke Reggie, I be too edgy
My bitch a veggie, bitch, I'm a legend
Pull out my flag, and these niggas start pledgin'
Go pull up whenever, we ain't gotta schedule it
Boy, I'm a president, presidential Rollie
Bezel it heavily, inspect it carefully
I'm smokin' like I'm in the Netherlands
Like I'm a hippie that's stuck in the 70s
You with your buddies, I'm with my bloodies
And this ain't no flag, lil' nigga, this rugby
Duct-tape that nigga up until he a mummy
Then put him in a freezer until we get hungry

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & O.T. Genasis]
Huh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go (Tell me where to go)
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope (No, no, no)
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow
Every time I'm O.T., my bitch cry like T.O. (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope (Steppin' on the dope)

Got the dope (Yeah), got the scope (Yeah)
Got the coke (Yeah) off the boat
Got the grams, make it float
Ask my plug, ""What's the quote?"" (Go)
I shoot at all of my enemies (Yeah)
Walk around like I'm Yosemite (Yeah)
Extra clip, that's my amenities (Aagh)
I'ma send shots like a Hennessy (Who? Bah, bah, bah)
Bitch, I'ma shoot like a penalty (Mm, bang)
Keep me a flag like a penalty (Bap, bang)
Niggas know me, O.T. (O.T.)

Momma said God took his time when he made me

Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happy his goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'
You been blabbin', you been bickerin'
I been blackin' I been sippin' like the Dracula
I been feelin' like Galactus
Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know that I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'

Back when them hoes was wearing Juicy Couture, yeah
Back when niggas was still wearing Velour, eh
When shit got out of hand, my hands was full, I'm
Going through some shit, yeah, but you know I ain't broke up
Just talked to Ms. Cita, she told me, ""Stay focused""
I said, ""Alrighty then,"" gotta make up my mind again
Fuck the bullshit, the fake and the counterfeit
Gotta shake it like Iverson, gotta take out my pocket lint
And make something out of it, like a scientist
Be creative and confident; no vacation, just power trips
Limo tint, limo tint 5 percent, Louie V moccasins
Treat her cat like a lioness, I’m on my Mufasa shit
Yeah, I'm saucy like pasta, bitch, I'm talking all kinda shit
Yeah, and I got that Flakka dick, them bitches be out of it
And I be OT with my bro T and Lil Hoody and Skateboard E

With shotguns under both wings

Ain't no peace, we chop off both fingers

I got the tattoos, all I need is the nose ring
Pour party at my place, more codeine than chlorine
Spraying at your head like some fucking Afro Sheen

And I'm a Martian, I'm marching on the stars and moon
I come through in something without a roof
Staggerin', I'm flaggin', I'm reppin' Suwu

I spend it, I spend it, make it back next day
I pull up, I pull up, and I fade away

And then I started pumpin' like the Shell
And when I started fuckin', I was young
And when I started cuppin', I was sprung
And then I started druggin', it was fun
Fuckin' with that honey, I got stung
And when I go out clubbin', I be numb
Started out from nothin', just some crumbs
Started up from nothin', just some crumbs
And now I got a bakery, yum, yum
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery

I got my main bitch feeling immortal
I got my ex bitch feeling insulted
Cause wifey get money like Kimora
I got a fine bitch feeling exhausted
Cause I'mma put this dick on her 'til tomorrow
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber
I go down and kiss her Pearl Harbor
She's so down with this New World Order
Fuck the shit out her in a sauna
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton
Got a goon named Fernando
At the front door your condo

He don't care, he's psycho
Bad bitch with a nice throat
She ice cold and she like hoes

And put your own face on a milk carton
Busy, I’ve been so busy
Ain’t even got time for quickies
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy
I’m out here tryin' to get me
I’m coming back out jumpin' like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy

I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch

Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea

If she don't suck dick I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it, nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic, nigga

And if you're standing in the way then mama missing her son

Rest in peace from the Hollygrove crew
Tell ya momma I will do whatever she need me to do

I'm a kidnapper, if ya bitch look good bet I'm a get at her
She see me in the coupe I put the petal to the metal
If ya boy wanna trip I put the ratta to the tatta
Everybody scatter tryna get the fuck away
Sparks fly, glass shatter, situation gets sadder
Daddy I'm a pitcher, who's the next batter
I whip it like gadda and I throw it right at em
Junior high school, high school when I had em
Had 10 dollar bags 25 dollar package

I don't love her, I don't trust her
Nigga own mother told me the bitch loves to hustle
Gotta get that paper baby, gotta get that cake
Cop a black Lamborghini, put gold on the plates
Home to the beach, sand at my feet
R1 one wheel hanging off the seat

We use to blow 2 or 3, tell me all about the streets
My nigga Soulja Slim had a motherfuckin message

First bullet out the barrel nigga better guard your face
Say my nigga Lil Spitta he in the game let's play
He about to take over for my half time break

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
Now once upon a time not long ago
He was in the hospital and damn near broke
And all he had was a mask and a Glock
A box of baking soda and a couple of pots
The streets was empty, the fiends was hungry
He wanted to give em just what they wanted
To get cheap coke all he needed was connect
So he called his homie Wayne from the Hollygrove set

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Yes, then I got his call, I'll be on the way
Don't worry about nothing but that money to be made
Met up with Spitter we got the shit straight
And I gave him the dope and I kept the yay
Now we on the grind and the bitches know who we are
I come through in the car like gosh
My posture as delicate as fur, I'm all hers
Cut niggas head like barbers, fruity ass niggas is Starburst
Throw em in the ceiling fans

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, blue skies, blue skies

Bust your fucking grape, nigga
Turn your shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high, nigga
I'm too gone, bye nigga
She get dick, weed, and ignored
Thats a D.W.I., nigga
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin'
The pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seeing shit
I'm blowing like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong
Got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fucking Mary-Jane
I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger
I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back
And keep blinking like hazards
I said king me, king me
With my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs
My cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse
What I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard
Bitch, look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth
I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again
OK, I'm reloaded

Shoutout to my weed man
Shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something
I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga, don't blow it
I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm coming or going
T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashing, life passing
Take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses
Shot glasses
Hot flashes
My tongue's numb, I can't talk
No balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks
I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell
High as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies
I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit
I hope I trip and fall in some pussy

Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga

"[Intro: Leah Kunkel Sample]
City streets, that's where I learned
Play with fire, you get burned
When the heat was on, I turned
Turned to trouble... trouble

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, C3, yeah
New Orleans baby
A street called Eagle
And everybody's ill
Yeah, ill-egal
People steal cars
We steal people
We eat like dogs
But we still people
And even when ya lost
Trouble still see you
And even if ya dead broke
We are still equal
One time for the lil people
Eat ya meal, don't let ya meal eat you
(I run with trouble...)
StreetRunner we crazy with this one
I, run, with, trouble

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And just the other day my nigga Chris killed his self
I pray to God that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when there's no help?
He figured heaven, so he went left
Y'all know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds coming, bells ringing
(I run with trouble...)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama loved a drug dealer, straight quit her job
They took his life
And along with him I died
And she died
We died
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me ""Daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes
And see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & (Leah Kunkel Sample)]
(I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over cheap wine)
Ya know
Just kick it back
(Still I look for brighter times)
I can't call it
(I run with trouble...)
Ya know? Heheh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
The tooly poke out the jeans
The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans
Ya na mean?
And everything ain't what it seem
Ya na mean?
And don't play that game without your team
Kill for my bread, kill for my cheese, kill for my cream
I will have that red beam on high beam
Now I hear sirens
Wait I think I see one behind me
I ain't trippin baby, money got me
(I run with trouble...)
And fuck the police, fuck the feds too
I ain't jumpin' in that jumpsuit
A one-two, I'm on my one-two
Check me out
I fuck around and check you
Respect due
Pay yours nigga
Mine's under the seat
By my feet
Where yours nigga?
Too much hoarse liquor huh
Too much pressure, too much force
Too much money
You never heard that before
Shit
And we stop the snitches at the door
Cut that tail off the rat
He won't rat no more
(I run with trouble...)
That's right
Get trapped fuckin' with my cheese
Keep shooting 'til I burn my sleeves
Nigga, please
These boys is Gs
Represent New Orleans like a fleur-de-lis
Shit
What you know about it
We more than thieves
Steal from the rich
So the poor can eat
Niggas act up
My niggas act accordingly

"[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, ""I said I've been lookin' for me""
I've been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
I've been lookin' at the cross and it just look like a T
Two fingers, I keep 'em crossed, I can't be lookin' for peace
I've been lookin' at the stars and they don't glisten for me
I've been lookin' in the mirror, he don't listen to me, sheesh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne]
If I die before I wake (Yeah)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take (Uh)
I lost count of my mistakes (Shit)
At least I learned along the way

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne, Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
And I don't trust nobody (Nobody), not my lovers, not my friends (Nobody)
I don't make no promises (No promises) 'cause I know just how they'll end
And I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
You gon' find a bunch of motherfuckers lookin' like me
I ain't ever lookin' back because the light always green
Safe to say I lost my way but I never lost the lead
Safe to say I lost the brakes but I never lost the speed
Wakey-wake, I lost some sleep but I never lost the dream
If you out there at the crossroads lookin' for me
You gon' find me with my eyes closed lookin' for grief

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne, Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
If I die before I wake (Yeah)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take (Uh)
I lost count of my mistakes
At least I learned along the way

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself, yeah

"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay I'ma throw a tantrum on this beat
Now who wanna play fetch?
When it comes to the drugs, boy we shop at Payless
Shawty came too many times, left the whole bed wet
Mack the thinker, I'm the Blood - Method Man, Redman
A scared man a dead man, can I get a amen
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the headrest
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless
Like I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust the clique I ride for
If I see 'em in the streets I'ma have to treat 'em like a rival
I'm a pleasure to your eyeballs
I'm so fly I shop at Skymall
Mama never bought me knockoffs
Lord I need some wood to knock on
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn
I got somethin' very hot on my hip, I get my hip hop on
And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on
Point guard with the bullets; you say Rájon, I say Rajon
Yeah, hold up; we them boys, we them wild boys
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points
Menace to society, menace to myself though
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow
And you don't want no problem, I'm a problem
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack
You gotta shoot the rat when it get too big for the mousetrap
Shoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I'll ""Pow"" back
Flip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat
Bitch I'm Tommy Gun Tunechi
Favorite color ruby
Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses
Triple A dick, that's Amazin' And Amusin'
I'm sedated and secluded
I'm the greatest and improvin'
But my baby mama say I'm livin' wrong
Well if I die then I guess she dead right
Catch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga
I'll catch your pussy ass at a red light
And you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka
I represent my killers like Johnnie Cochran
We kidnap mamas and toddlers
We don't give a fuck if they ass adopted
Brief moment of silence for Chris Wallace
Soulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they smilin'
And Weezy still hot as tamales
My private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless
I'm so sorry for the wait

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard
I'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole Dej Loaf
My Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein
She a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets
My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow
My weed funky like armpits and assholes
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac
It's like she's two different persons; she be chillin', she be cursin'
Cry a river, squirt a ocean
Fuck fast, in slow motion
Man I know Soulja proud of me (ya heard me?)
Man, I know Soulja Slim proud of me (ya heard me?)
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late
And I ain't apologetic, but, sorry for the wait
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late
And I usually ain't apologetic, but
Sorry 4 The Wait

It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas

Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane

Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base

Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball

Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever

CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, ""Tune, not in my mouth,"" damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like ""excuse you""
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, ""See, you gon' drink your life away""
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it

My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me

But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig em a hole, let the property hide em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I'll never fail, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah may seem cool
But me,I'd rather not let them see my food
I'm staying strapped like fila shoes
Bet I bust the motherfucker till the enemy move
C'Mon!
Its my game nigga get in & lose
Y'all niggas never do what I do, I do me",Lil Wayne,U Don’t Know Weezy,
"I'm so sick I go to the hospital
When I don't get fixed I get nicked by the brain surgeon
If I'm losing ya, sorry I'm just brain surfing
Move in ya mind like a five in the lanes twerk it
But I'm like a six with ya bitch twerk that
I'm on the strip with ya bitch working
And I don't like strippers, I like dyke bitches
That don't like strippers; that, like bitches
Like to fight strippers, Weezy F. Baby
I don't write shit, be on the hype shit
She on that white shit
I ain't talking about cum, put powder on my dick
Then she suck it til she numb, shit
I remember back in the day
When an ounce of coke was four hundred
And them bitches was gay
But now these niggas is gay
And you could probably get an ounce for eight
Shit, if you spend eleven hundred you straight
And now the niggas with money is the niggas that hate
And bitches want a broke nigga cause them bitch niggas fake
But that's why me, and my hooligans debating, ho
Which one of these rich niggas we taking?
I gotta make it, Lil Layla's six now
My little brother J.E. wanna cop bricks now
And little Marley, he just hold his chick down
Get 'em a Benz so he can roll his chick round
I blow big in a 'Lac like a big dawg
I keep that sig in my lap like my dick dawg
Shit make me bust a nut in yo face
Tell ya girlfriend, ""Bitch
Wipe the slut off yo face, ho""
Where you from? I'll put you under your state
Then I go and throw a party at Bungalow 8
Yeah I'm something so straight feared I
Knock a nigga right up in his queer eye
I ain't playing nigga this is the year I must excel
Fans sending in cards say you must get well soon
Because I'm sick, so sick sick mean
I be with a cute thing
And she do her lip thing
Well as a matter fact I think you know her well
Everytime I'm with the girl you always blowing up her cell
What, would you stop me and shorty tryna chill, man
Shorty tryna feel on my eel
I shock her like Silk
I Chaka like I'm managing a Ludacris
Handling the uzi like a camera

Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like ""Un momento""
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say ""Ooh, I like your cologne""
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried 'bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga

Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new niggas
I blues your bitch ass, hope somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my floor, take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitches lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My niggas like Kanye with that good, my niggas like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw your bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy, I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes, I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat
Niggas be lukewarm at the most and when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote, Tunechi

Uh, my cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these ho's ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than a armadillo
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot, let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life, all I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour, twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME, T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead

Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her, yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck niggas, you already know us

You ain't heard the latest, Weezy F. the greatest

Leave it to the flow, we gettin' dough like the bakery
I don't really want to, but these niggas makin' me

That's a hockey team, and I ain't on no hockey team
But I'm a champion, where's the fuckin' Rocky theme
Damn, Rest In Peace Apollo Creed
I'm a monster, every day is Halloween
A lot of syrup, lot of pills, and a lot of weed
And I keep my pockets green like a pod of peas
And if you hatin' baby, you can get a side of deez
Deez nuts in your mouth, and can you swallow please?

Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though

At your front door with a gun stowed
""Knock, knock. Who's there?"" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you

Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
Used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

I still don't know today
Was he playing with the gun or was it an accident
I still... I just don't.... I.... I be wanting to ask him but I never asked him after all these years
Was that a accident or did he... or was he playing with the gun
So I never really found out about what...
You know what happ-... what really happened with him and that shooting",Lil Wayne,Used 2,
"[Intro: RiFF RAFF & Drake]
Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' PlayStation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to, yeah (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Outro: Drake & Lil Wayne, RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to, yeah (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man
And I'm so sorry
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this? How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions? We ain't doing no interview!",Lil Wayne,Used To,Drake
"[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Why me? Oh-why oh-why-oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

[Verse 1]
My-my scene just a crime scene
Got the high beams and the sirens, yeah
My team, we divide teams
Talkin' dirty money? Check the hygienes
All the dirty money get dry cleaned
Talkin' dirty money, Sam Rothstein
Had my goons kidnap your offsprings
While I was working on my golf swing
Ooh, sweet dreams, sour nightmares
It's a cold world, I got an ice grill
No one man should have all that power
If he can't afford to pay the light bill
I got a forcefield over my heartbeat
The window seal with no door key
I'm poppin' pills to feel more me
Cut off the wings now I'm soaring
And I never feel like poor me
I'd rather feel like the old me
I was born with wheels and I roll deep
I could make the devil get cold feet
Don't light the clove unless it's four leaf
Get a pussy wetter than a coral reef
On my face, I tatted me a Fleur de Lis
Should I get it covered with a coca leaf?
I could tell you better than you showed me
I could show you better than you told me
I'm an OG up in OT and it's no sleep till it's roast beef
I better not hear a Little Bo-Peep
Better go figure, better go deep
Pass no judgement, pass your weed
I'm the GOAT nigga, no goatee

[Chorus]
Why me? Oh-why oh-why-oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

[Verse 2]
Mmm, sippin' on purple like it's herbal
Bad brown bitch, Lisa Turtle
On turbo, you don't wanna disturb him
Momma put too much sugar in my Gerber
Damn, I done dropped too many ashes on my turban
I done seen so many titties on Bourbon
Live a different kind of lifestyle
Different color diamonds, got a nigga lookin' like sherbert
Stepped to the plate, knocked it out the park
Eat a nigga face like a tiger shark
Dressed in all red like Olajuwon
My niggas hit your safe like the Holocaust
My niggas catch a case, feel like I got Moss'd
My nigga treat the K just like a love
Got a lawyer and an agent but I'm the boss
And my heart always racin' but never lost
Hello? I was the illest nigga on child support
Now I'm lookin' at the riot report
Went and looked at the final score
Bedroom got revolvin' doors
Bitches in and out smilin' more
Than children smilin' at a carnival
Ain't got nothing in common but the common cold
Big Bs nigga, honor roll
Hold up, I think I found the flow
Started from the bottom bitch
Never been monogamous, never been monotonous
Never been anonymous, money is unanimous
Always had accomplices, always had conglomerates
Always let the chopper clip stick out like a bottom lip
You runnin' out of time, so you better know what time it is
You runnin' out of tears and you runnin' out of volunteers
Young Mula bitch, I die for the logo
Cocaine price low, call that a low blow
Tunechi like Pablo, kis in the rowboat
Tunechi in the yacht though, still don't showboat
Sippin' on the slowpoke, movin' like a tugboat
Smokin' like a steamboat, fuckin' on a love boat
Better read the ransom note before you read the love note
Don't know if it's sore throat, deep throat or cut throat

[Chorus]
Why me? Oh-why oh-why-oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

[Outro]
Oh why am I so kamikaze
Why can't I stay in my seat?
I'm so hyphy try me
Why do I see these bloody bodies?
Why do I love what I see?
Why me? Oh-why oh-why-oh why me?
R.I.P., if you can't live in peace, then you can die in peace
As your eyes close and mines bleed, I need Vizine",Lil Wayne,Vizine,

This is me, fourth solo album baby, I came back around
By myself this time, back off the wall

Welcome, this is the Carter y'all welcome
Hard as Malcolm, dark as The Falcon, Lord help him
But y'all felt him, and that make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughta be
Doing, recording me, I'm just acting accordingly, I give orders
To the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me, I just hand 'em to P
Any drama, I pace it like Indiana
I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one starting to heat up
Got Mannie hot with me cuz I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up starting to look like V'd up
I'm G'd up on the re-up up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin about no speakers

What you need? Get you crack, get you weed
Make your way to the back, look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom giving head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Then he tried to ruin it, but I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that, let's keep it movin'
Onto the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin'
Uh huh, look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked, look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from Promethazine to Metamucil
I'm crucial, don't mean to spook you
But, this is New Orleans, so my queens do voodoo, ya know?
So the things just move through
I feel your pain, I got things to soothe you

Don't hate the game hate the institution
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution, fucker

Everybody look at me, like I'm riding on stage
Gotta woman named Sage, she twice my age
Every time she hit me up she send a picture, with a page
I ain't tryin’ to fall in love, I ain't tryin’ get engaged
You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead
Every time I'm tryin’ to leave she beggin’ me to stay
And I politely fade away like my name was M.J
And she wrote me a note, guess what that note says?
Well, I hope you still like me but I go both ways
And then I say Oh, then I say Okay
Stabbed them up and got the fuck like my name was O.J

Short sweet, red cute, ole vibrant thang

She said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself
Then she tell me my love is the best she's felt
And she sucked my dick like it’s about to melt
She drink Vitamin Water, say it’s good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt
Then there’s another bitch, her name was Ayesha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time it was so good, I told her to order one mo'
She said it’s not Domino's -- its DiGiorno's
There’s another bitch I met her at the Gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
I can't forget about my bitch named Meaty-boo
She’s a young project bitch, I used to bring that hoe to school school
So I brung her to the school  we standing on the yard
The bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward
Niggas came out the cut and started muggin’ me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
And I told my old lady ""I’ll be back, you see"" and hit me up on my cell phone

I'll still beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can’t fit in my pockets but I'll bet that gun fit
And I’m so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You'll get served around this ho
Yeah, you'll get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don’t splurge around no ho, no I don’t shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick I be like ""Find the front do' bitch""
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her dickhead, spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head, your flow sick? My shit dead
Sillier than V.I.C. said, Soulja Boy and Arab
You should see my 11 year old daughter do they dance
I call it the Nae-Nae dance, proud to be Nae-Nae’s dad
Gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland
We are not the same, I am a Martian, this is Space Jam
No Ceilings, R.I.P., Amen
Motherfucking caveman, beating on my chest
Young Money, Cash Money, and I'm eating all the rest
Nigga, no offense, sorry if you're offended
Riding high like I'm on 54 inches
Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches
Ch-chill like, ch-chill like an Eskimo, let's get mo', let's get mo' bitches
And I be like ""Let's get mo' bitches""
Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop lettin' the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smokin' on that Bob Marley, listenin' to Pete Tosh
I-I-I do me, no, I do three at a T-I-M-E
Why when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there
Yeah, you see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wanna be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten my girl be a twenty
My girls so bad make a nigga think he's sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two, three; I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been ridin'
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stuntin', but no, I'm just survivin'
And I’ve been here, but my soul is just arrivin'
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribin'
Medication free, and for meditation we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P, as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft and bring the whammies back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga's woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these Evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami though
I act so New Orleans, yes, I go Pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll
I just flew 2 hoes in, oh how time flies, clip its wings
Make you spit that safe combination, out like Listerine
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips

California kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on
We get high as fuck then we ""Just Do It"" put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock: I call it ""round the Carter""
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!
First-class pussy, crystal glass pussy
I get it wetter than bass pussy

She like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed
She got that pink pussy, I beat it orange/red
I fuck American pie and I get foreign head
She sit down and ride like I'm a thoroughbred
She kiss mine, and I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch

I'M COPPIN' A MEAL TICKET
No matter the consequence
My emphasis is to get it
It's Trina Weezie F. Baby
MANNY HANDLE the scripts
It's all reminiscent to
Gladys KNIGHT AND the PIPS
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick
It ain't gonna be no standin around
Now lets get crunk in this bitch
And ladies
Show em yo shit
A lil hip a lil THIGH
More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i
Or my big 600
Believe Trina done it
Believe I'M diamond studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase GRANDS cause I am what I am
Don't give a damn
Go

(Chorus)
Back to the lesson at hand
Stick to my plan
When it comes to seein man after man
Don't give a damn about his car or his GRANDS
Wh Wh WhWhat
Cause I'm gonna make my on ends
That's WhWhat's up
Ladies lets say you want a man
But don't kno how to do it
Dirty dance with em
Put a lil back into it
GO CATCH A wall shorty
End up at the mall sporty
Try to dog waddy?
Make em spend it all on ya
Yep and make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin for that kitty kat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that
Just let him know
Say make a bitch rich
Cause the badest bitch taught you that

"Nigga i'm young as a muhfucka
But money a muhfucka
Young money muthafucka, get it in blood puddles
Shit, i'm in the south but we living in mud puddles
Shit is a drug stuggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the street
Where the eyeses hide
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probley hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like oceans elevan
And i'm motioned to meddle, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when i;m rolling expecially like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know theres something in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state just put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at popadoes
They want beef I'll turn to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationshp with expensive cloths
This stuntin shit is expensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit
Im way smarter man, im more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
Im so im so so lifted, high in the sky
Me and pops taking pictures
Thats my vision and untill my vision
Is vivid ima give it all I got we good jigga you bitches",Lil Wayne,Weezy F. Baby (Dedication),
"[Hook 1: Lil Wayne & Stephanie Acevedo]
You can throw up peace, I'm throwin' squad up
Had to get the dreads bleached, the James Blonde look
I'm 'bout to put my hands on her like E. Honda
She walkin' around in a Young Money Tee without a bottom
She squad
It's a Secret society, these niggas tiny, I'll be your body
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
From the rooftops

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Young Tune winnin' now
You know I been winnin' then and now anyhow
Anyway, don't start no shit if you can't finish loud
I've been away, I've been around
I've been busy doin' business
Mind your business 'fore I shut your fuckin' business down
She say my lyrics like a lifeline when she down
She checkin' bitches off my timeline when she down
But all them bitches on the sideline, out of bounds
Watchin' us play around

[Verse 2: Stephanie Acevedo]
Stephanie and Weezy now
The birds birds birds are you singing now?
They gonna' keep a lil Puerto-rican out
A lil' souvenir gotta get me now
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Turn Xan on your bitch you are just Plain Jane
I just laugh at the shit with my bad bitch gang (gang gang)
Cause' you ain't a bad bitch without a YM chain

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I second that shit you ain't lyin' that's game
I tell your nigga meet me outside in the rain
I shoot him up like a hundred times then again
Again and again, are you not entertained?
Ain't no better drugs than the ones I know
I done went down on bitches I don't know
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
And right now I'm both, got me talking bout you hoe

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne & Stephanie Acevedo]
Said she really love the blonde look
So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
And I'm screaming
Fuck your team, fuck your team, fuck your team, Like 2Pac
Sip slow, no blowin' highs, no killin' vibes
We touch each other, touch the skies, she rub her eyes
She cry Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
She cry Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
Then I zoom out

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I said ""Tell me who you loyal to?""
Is it Weezy? Is it Wayne? Is it Tunechi? Is it gang?
Or these no-names hanging with a nigga with a name?
How you poppin' pain pills and you living with the pain?
You can't tell me that ain't horrible
And my love always free when the lights get dark
I know love isn't cheap I got a nice-ass job
You look priceless to me, I'll rip your price tag off
Baby ""Tell me who you loyal to?""
Do you start with the money or the man?
Does it end with your heart in your hand?
Fuck it, if the money bag in the other hand, that was the plan
Let that nigga spoil you
I guess somebody else on grind mode
But a nigga that provide though
Put his pride to the side though, and you my slime, so

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne & Stephanie Acevedo]
Said she really love the blonde look
So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
I'm 'bout to put my hands on her like E. Honda

Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, zoom out

Had to get the dreads bleached, the James Blonde look
She saw my pic on IG, now she's inspired
She dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's some sick shit! Money Team

[Skit: Lil Wayne]
See, this Dedication mixtape series is so important to the culture because they say it is. It's plain and simple, plain and simple. I don't label it important to the culture. If I have ever labelled it important to the culture I was feelin' myself and smellin' my drawers -- uh, pause -- I'm old, my mama used to always say that, my grandma used to say that ""You smellin' your drawers."" -- but anyway, I don't know if y'all people say that, I'm from the south -- but yeah, the Dedication mixtape series is important to the culture because the culture say it's important. So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say ""We want that, we need that, we gotta have that."" It make the-it make the world know what I mean? It make the music world spin, and that's what it's all about, and it's 'cause they say it",Lil Wayne,Weezy N Madonna,Stephanie Acevedo

She say, who you telling shut up, then she get up
Start packing her shit up, start calling her sister
Sister dosen't pick up, the tension start to pick up
She crying, she got hiccups, I'm tellin her to cheer up

No this ain't game but I can be found in it
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it
So I be playing til the last minute, you don't get it
See that ground hurt when you hit it, I wouldn't lie baby
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby
So far from the buttom I swear
Smell the work in the air, I'm there

I done went blonde, goin' Hulk Hogan on they ass
Tell my shooters ""Count me out"", and I end up doin' the math
I been fuckin' in the shower so my dreads soaked
I been fuckin' on the counter 'cause my bed's soaked
You know my lean nice and cold, like some dead folks
You know my eyes nice and low, like I make egg rolls, oh
I got them pills, we call 'em illies
I got the wet, I'm water whippin'
I rob his ass like Robin Givens
I get them Ms a mile a minute
Don't pay your bill, I'm power trippin'
BET, that's how I'm livin'
I got three hoes followin' me
Ho, ho, ho; I'm down the chimney
Hello, I make her throw away her pussy toys, yeah
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed, yeah
She do the money count in just her drawers, yeah
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I been fuckin' models, they been walkin' 'round in towels
They been snortin' powder, I been in here takin' downers
They been countin' for hours, getting kisses by the thousands
Money and the power, they be in here watchin' Power
All my shooters accurate, codeine like a daiquiri
Run up, run up in your factory, mask is on like Michael Jackson
Brrrt! Pull up like a taxi, stereo on maxi
Nigga, bury your own casket

My lil homies bang, my lil homies, they deranged
They don't want the fame, kill your ass then fly to Spain
Ding-ding, coke and ice cream, that shit got a nice ring
Put my face up in the pussy, I'm just sight-seeing
Yeah, starin' at the world through an automatic
Sweet mother of pearl, sweet Jesus of Nazareth
Quickly, quickly, quickly, gettin' slow, baby
I could turn your baby to a poor baby, sure baby
Look, I cannot sit down without gettin' down
What's new in town? Let's do it now
A couple marbles ain't been found
A couple screws been screwed around
My father ain't been 'round, my heart ain't missed a pound
The system of a down, and it's been up and down
A psycho, all I'm missin' is the gown
Sippin' up, I piss enough to drown, twistin' up a pound
High as fuck, a Bentley truck on clouds, y'all so underground
I break a whole bunch of fuckin' vows
Come to hunt you down
All up in your section
Use protection when you fuck around
Possession of deception, imperfection, no affection
No correct your transgression, turn depression to aggression
Got an obsession for expression
With no pressure, no discretion, and the F is for the
""Flesh of all the fleshless ones, I left 'em, F 'em.""

The world is on my shoulders
Should I dust my shoulders off?

Man pussy has a pattern and I know where I’m going
And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if they'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part

Look look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look

[Verse 1]
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust bang!
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Weezy Wee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'mma hit the block and borrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood

I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun

[Verse 3]
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Weezy kill 'em all easy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun

Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit

[Verse 1: Wayne]
Weezy F. Baby, the mothafuckin Carter
Bitches on my stick but my name ain't Harry Potter
They think I'm very hotter, your girl say the same
And since we like to travel, she let us run a train
And my defense put me in the Hall of Fame
I make her turn over every time we play the game
Your boy Wayne, ask them niggas how I came
In a Ferrari, Jaguar switchin both lanes
Living room in the kitchen on a plane
I get from A to B so comfortably, I
Do my thing, y'all niggas so plain
I'm so fly, call me Soul Plane

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wayne]
To him, I'm a killer, to her, I'm a lover
I always wear a mask, and I always wear a rubber
Yeah, I'm from the hood, but my crib in the suburbs
They love a nigga VIBE, so thats why I got the cover
My nigga Mack Maine is like a brother from another
We from the same hood, we will kill a motherfucker
We eat you niggas lunch, and to bitches I'm supper
She ask me to go down, I'm like, ""As long as I fuck her""
I wear I lot of diamonds, see baby I'm a stunna
So ride a nigga dick, for a baby-bear Hummer
And homie, you can have her, cause I don't really want her
You put the dick in her, I put the dick on her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm hotter than fire, she wetter than a bitch
These niggas really pussy, and I'm harder than my dick
I show too much love for you to be a hater
I ain't home every day, but I'm gettin' my paper
I know what's going on cause I'm the creator
And since I'm so early, I holla at 'em later
I sound like sex comin' through the fader
Bitch, I'm the president, not the mayor

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
Married to the block, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you straight to the needle
The bottle, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband used to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck either

The stormy weather where the trees don't bend back
Left home at 16, I ain't never been back
When it come to being broke they say I never been flat
A punk ass bitch, I ain't never been that
Reminisce on daddy's caught a schlitz in his lap
And it's Newport Box with only one stick left
Snort heroine, then he shove me in his chest
Used to really believe I'll never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulder cause the devil sing the rest
Right on it through his bignes with them poisonous syringes
Beating on my mama, kick the door of the hinges

Let's make simple sense of the main difference
Angel of Death swing, got a sinner in a clench
Revolver in my fist, earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line, watch me catch 'em with this
Coke fly off compound, off round white rock
Balling like Earl Manigault in his high top
Third eye cyclops, beaten down my five cops
Left for dead and this ain't even my block
Thinking of my pops, thinking of my moms
Rather be just blazing listening to Saigon
Cause when you think up God strike you down
Body full of current, lightning never hit the ground

Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already

Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'mma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when he wouldn't? I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot, hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)

Had to move The Carter by the water, nigga
But I'm still too scared to get in the water, nigga
'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is holes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga

We don't even socialize
I feel like North Korea
Even though we oceanside
All I say is ""Mama-mia""
She don't even know her moms
All she say is ""This your pussy""
She say that to most of the guys
She don't even know it's dry
I can't even open fire
She don't even close her eyes
She don't even close the blinds
She spit all over the D
I'm sticky like porcupines
She don't even compromise
I still make her cum three times
I still make her snort some lines
And make her look so surprised
I still her make her recognize
Make her exercise to a sexier size
Then I tell her how to tell better lies
Now her extra guys think she never lie
We got a better bond, we have a better time
She got a wetter pond
I cum ahead of time, and a second time
And in record time
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I make a second line
I'm a Megatron
I got her legs up like the Omega sign
And I know she rolling 'cause I checked her tires
Then I checked her eyes, she a little rough around the edges, fine
Like Checkers fries
And the X was mine
She requested five
So I gave her two and told her stretch the high
We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh
Then she woke up high, like ""Oh my God"" and tried to rectify
But if you naked, why?
If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot
I'ma wake the block, I'ma break the lock
Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out
I'ma shake my head when you turn around
Cops shake they head when they see your house
We shot it up, but look like we burned it down
Hor-Horror scene, bitch
Everyday Halloween, bitch
Kidnap, hide and seek, bitch
I'm a legend like Socrates, bitch
I aim at your collard green, bitch
Bada-boom, bada-bing, bitch
I'm looking for a solid, clean bitch
I tell her ""Look, honestly, bitch""

You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me

And you just on the side of me

Bed sheets so nice, bed bugs don't bite
I ask her do she wanna fuck, before I ask twice, she say
Yes I am a beast, I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant, next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy, oh, how do I love that panty pie
Keep my hair shampooed and yes, I keep my hands sanitized

Ok I'm leanin' to the left, flag in my right pocket
Star Trek fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial, I'm all about my decimals
Retarded in the booth, they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda spit crack and you niggas is crack addicts
It's simple mathematics; you cut the check
And I rake in the green like I'm rakin' the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin'
Call my whip Martin, but the first name Aston
Potatohead niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin
Think you fuckin' with me? Put your cash in
Nah, I doubt it;
I was young and reckless when P say he was about it
You niggas is Ducks, Howards, Cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours, Gudda, bitch~!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis', black semi'
I've never sat in the Hemi, that will offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach, bitch I got stacks
Yeah, Paychecks on paychecks and I still want payback
I still don't play that, I kill on ASAP
And we don't do shit but get money all day
Put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin' your way
YM, Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama? I'm honored
I blitz yo' ass like a mothafuckin' lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of commas
Still wear red like an old 49er
Fuck shittin' on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F baby, bitch I'm hotter than Uganda
Uggh!

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Let-let go
Mo-momma ain't make me to make homies, she made me to make history
So doin that my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and my target is the industry
Two things in the world I love - good head and victory
You ain't doin' it big, I'm grown, stop kiddin me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr. T
This is Misery, no Kathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money'll slap you straight
Yeah, I'm a big joker so you know I'll smash your ace
Leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
Love is a gamble, but it's my casino
And tonight you're the loser, I hope she got Aveno
I hope the game got life insurance cause I'mma kill it
And all you whack ass rap niggas dyin with it
I'm so Harlem, eatin but still starvin'
Po-pockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine
Millz!

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Say, put the flow
Say, put the flow in the pot, crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top, this finger lickin hot
His pick flip cause the nigga flopped
My shit hit like the pitch was soft, niggas cottonballed
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy crossed guard but, I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fuckin law
Her baby daddy gone, who wanna meet the Don?
That Rocky shit up on the arm-arm
Shittin on 'em like hay in the barn
Hey wait they say Money talks and, man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini-malls

Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It’s YME, nothin' gets in between us

[Verse 2: Lil' Chuckee]
Tell Wayne I’m goin' in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game, nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rockin' with Young Money
I told my team I got us man, it’s all on me
Like Volume two B.G., I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Every time I’m on the track it’s ransom
Can’t find us anymore, it’s random
When Young Money come through you better salute us

Hey I solemnly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never got to call me cause I’mma be there
Let's get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shell toes
Strapped like Velcro and is we running hell no
And truthfully, aimin' for number one, oh do we
You ask why I reply 'cause nobody remember two or three
Cross YM out of him we'll make a movie
We all we can be, respect the army and salute we

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money army, we marching
We coming forward, no warning
We got these boys running like Forrest
So salute me like a general
First place, never last
Always on top and I’m a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in a stranglehold​ no letting up
You can get the top of your can popped like 7-Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
I’ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers, I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me
Cause Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops

Commander-in-Chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the world, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don’t ask me about shit but money
Fuckin’ right my money long I got that 10-foot money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I’m in deep like wet pussy
I’m a purple heart proven war vet, rookie
You can’t even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don’t step to me
Now don’t step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain’t we God’s children?
I know at all times gods feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me

Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied, wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They tryna tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim

"[Monologue]

Now listen...lemme preach to 'em
Lemme show 'em why..w-w-what it take...
I ain't gonna say why I'm better than others
'couse i ain't better than nobody, actually
But lemme show 'em why I'm a lot different from everybody else
Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference

The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything
So why wouldn't I do this all the time?
See that's the difference between you and I
You get money and you get crazy
I get crazy and I get money
And the biggest difference between you and I is...
You love me and I hate you",Lil Wayne,"You Love Me, I Hate You",

[Verse]
Well, tonight I found my price to the spender
And she cried about our life to the listener
And she asked me for advice, so I pimped her
Turn that chicken head to a chicken tender
In a Wraith, in a Wraith, out of state license plates
I got yay an AK and a temper
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Don't know how I'm drivin' straight
I sipped a lake of that grape, thirst quencher, oh
Girl, fuck with him and get your money
You fuck with me, you missin' money, then you miss your molly
I get the money, spend the money, then I miss the money
But it come right back, right back, right back
That's that Frisbee money
That's Santa climbin' down the chimney, money with the duffy
It come back, run around the gang, yeah that's some dizzy money
The Humpty Dumpty, she get on that dick, she's very comfy
I put a Rolie on her wrist, she used to wear a scrunchy
Party times, Tunechi wise
Wifey's size, truly lies
Booty, thighs, bougie pride
Gucci slides, moody, tired
Woozy, high, movie night
Jacuzzi time, ooo-ee, ahh
Dinner, prime; sushi, wine
And for dessert I have the cutie-pie
Lied about the price to the spender
And I lied about my height on Tinder
And if I hit it one time I won't remember
But can't forget it if she bring another member
Double date, double date
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Bitch, I'm eatin' full plate like November
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
In a different mind state
Let her sniff some snowflakes and call her Winter (yah)
Fuck with him and get the money
Then come fuck with me and split the money
I'll fuck her when she with her buddy
She guzzle dick and kiss her buddy
She said I love you when he send some money
I said I love you give your pimp some money
And she don't ask how much she just come dump it
And I don't ask how high I just start jumpin'
You ain't know I kiss below the button, what
Girl close your eyes and let me show you somethin', what
And if you ride me like the road is bumpin', what
I leave my key in and the motor runnin', what
Oh my god I hope they kissin' cousins
If they not it's gon' be consequences, repercussions
Woah, I just count a hundred thousand hundreds
And I told my babe ride the wave, Cowabunga
Lied about her night to her nigga
Her vagina 'bout to cry me a river
If she ask me for advice and I igged her
But she know it wasn't me, it was the sizzurp
Gotta wait, gotta wait
'Til I wake, 'til I wake
I wake up and tell bae how much I missed her
She looks straight in my face then start pointin' to the space
Where she want it on her face, she's particular

Fuck around with me and I just let that gat talk
Yeah, I'mma let that heat spray
Right where you standing that's where you gone lay
Still play it cool, get off the streets
Cops came to the house, moms told them I was sleep
Cause she memorized the script to a tee
Told them that I had the flu and I was in the bed for weeks
Yeah, another victim of a murderer
Got your family running asking people have they heard of ya
All over, putting up posters
Like you got an album about to drop
But there ain't nothing bout to drop but that casket

Though I'm coming back like I forgot my keys, yeah

Gorilla with the flow, nigga finna blow
Ice everywhere, chinchilla to the flo'

Nigga gained a little weight but the hoes still love me
Still let a nigga put the dick to they face
Run up in your crib, put the burner to your face
Leave the scene with out a trace at a earn hard pace
But no I ain't bail, I ain't tryna hit the wall
Tryna mack a little broad and get her back to the place
Yo man trip, I show 'em what the Ruger hold
Catch a flight to Jayville, can't miss the Super Bowl
Then it's back to the hood cause I love the streets
Better find Noah's Ark, bout to flood the streets

But I'm better than that with the rock
Tryna land me a spot at the Roc
And my city got word of that

"[Intro: Lil Wayne - talking]
I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy dukes fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)

I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody

And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggas love ya children

You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad no dressing, take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee, brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen, my homeboy like your sister
Maybe they can bake some cousins, ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, ""I-I love you too""
It's Wayne's world, she say, ""What is this world coming to?""
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, ""Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?"" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
""What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be""
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do",Lil Wayne,You Song,Chance the Rapper
"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Aw aw
Aw aw!
Aw aw!!
Peep me out, look!
Head bustin', black fatigues
So blunted, 400 degreez, it's Weezy
Nigga, respect it
When you see tha left hand buggin', nigga, respect it
But if you see tha left hand bustin', nigga, your disrespectin'
Took one to tha chest, I never die, I'm tha same brotha
Jump out and shoot K's, let 'em fly, I'm tha same brotha
It's a must they recognize that I'm untamed, brotha
Disconnect a boy like a damn change number
(Uhhh), hang up and try again
I kill ya, wake ya up, and make you die again
Spark it up, and make a nigga block fry again
Go ta jail, and do life, not five ta ten
Me, Lil' Mario, and Toolie, that's my man, fam
My niggas don't give a Jean-Claude Van Damme
About'chu, cause we don't play around
Bring tha K around, spray tha town, take tha ground
Take tha ground that you walk on
Tap tha phones that you talk on
Jam ya up and take your arms off
I hit you twice with tha sawed-off
And your neck, and just watch your head fall off... fall off
You think ya love me, I shoot anybody that look suspicious (what)
I bust tha street-sweeper until tha damn drum bust (what)
I hit tha hood, (I hit tha hood) be up in all black, (be in all black)
Numb-nut
I run up in your house with a tommy gun, what
I'm standin' there like I don't mind
Run through your clique like a weak defensive line
Yall ain't ready...

[Verse 2: Turk]
You want war, nigga, let's beef... beef
We can do it how ya want, or take it to tha streets... streets
I'll be dressed in camouflage, Ree's on my feet
Through your air (through your air) leave ya burnin' like heat
What ya..ain't know? I'm tha one from tha T.C
Chopper shooter, block bruiser, I'll bet any G (any G)
On fire, nigga, labeled as a HB
And if I can't kill you.. killin' your family (family)
Think it's a game, 'rilla, test my nuts, you'll see
How fast I send shots through your 6V (6V)
Heads bust if ya really think it's CMB
And I know you all know about Slim and B
We get our ball on, nigga, drink Cristy
Me and Buck get head from meekos in Tennessee
Betta ask somebody, nigga, I been a G
And Baby still servin' niggas for ten a key... nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Aw, aw, aw, look
Call me Big Baller, Big Tymer, Big Pockets
Call me Big Stunna, Big Stick, or Big Body
Call me that lil nigga with the rope full of diamonds
Call me the number one Hot Boy on fire
Fire, when you shoot outta town, then I'mma holler
With a crate of Crystile, couple of blunts, and a condom
Let him know if (let him know if) he down bad, that ain't my problem
Let him know if he come at me bad, then I'mma chop him
Ch-uh.. chop him
Put tha flame to him
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him
Cause I'm tha same nigga, pimper boy, Lil' Wayne
Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings
But since I usually... do the best at thangs
That mean I gotta wear a vest at thangs
I really think them niggas jealous... of tha sparkle in my necklace
Yall ain't ready.. yall ain't ready",Lil Wayne,You Want War,Turk
