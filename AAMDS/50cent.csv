G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
50 Cent nigga, Tony Yayo (yeah)
{WHOOOOOO... KID}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Yeah! And you don't stop
I do a 187 on your motherfuckin block
Yeah! And it don't quit
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

[Tony Yayo]
They say good things should happen to those who wait
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks
Cause my verse sound nice when they fly in hooks
Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama
I drive through in the blue data bomber
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger with the silencer
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block
Since niggas did the snake, running man and the wop
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers
I played the strip all night, servin niggas
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire
I had you on the run like Omar on ""The Wire""
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley
I be in M mansion, strippin them models
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'mma hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?

Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggas love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggas not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggas snatch Glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and Glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggas names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get layed out

[50 Cent - Chorus 2]
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hoes again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 2]
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me thats my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*harmonizing of ""doo, doo"" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) ""Life After Death"" and that 2Pac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole day I’m passing the green
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

When I'm dead and gone niggas gon' remember my name, 50

[50 Cent]
Black is flashy like Alpo, gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka 'mind me of nigga that clapped me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you tryna get your ass laid out in Gilmore
He had some soldiers, 'mind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like ""What up comrade?""
Grimy niggas, they loved to get gully
Summertime, still had on black gloves and skullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggas from Philly woulda called him an old head
But he a OG, 'mind me of Chaz and Bump, real low key
Sounded like they don't know nothin about drama
His money sent many men through trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on his S-Class
Heard in DC, he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this, a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit, he got knocked
He on lock still controllin the spot from Comstock
Pop pulled up in the CL5, surprised he came
His man just got fucking murked by some lame
Heard he got it in the Range nigga Caine popped one
On his brain over some-thang, took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond mayne
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
""Down down baby,"" Nelly singin my wrist blingin what?
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise, three loaves for two pies
Son he smokin that shit, I can see it in his eyes
Comin up Wise and locs is close
And locs ride 'round lookin for wires to toast
Benny hopped out the Escalade with a few thorough men
From B-More, they sellin heroin in Maryland
His first batch of diesel, he killed like 4 fiends
His popularity grew, that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother, now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to livin the dream
Seen he pulled up, goddamn, you know his format
Bentley Azure, marble in the door, mink floor mats
Hit the hazards, out the stash box popped two Glocks
Theme song: ""All Eyez on Me,"" 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Ty in the blue GS, stuntin like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max, Haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peeped his style son I know his steelo, he on the d-low
He smile at niggas mumblin fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggas tried to merk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a black Hummer, he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that, let's go

Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Verse 2]
Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time

Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks

Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn

Forget that, grip that, ride it nonstop

Just pull 'em to the side

Baby, come on and ride

Stand up or get on the floor

I know just how to break you off",50 Cent,Amusement Park,

I got that animal, animal ambition

[Verse 1]
Why give her love and affection, she just want some bread
I ain't talking or texting, I just want some head
She from a Piru set where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags, but I'm a gangster, bitch
I say ''say no to drugs'' then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips, I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it, nigga, eat a dick
I just call 'em when I want 'em, I don't need a bitch
You see me stunting with my diamonds on, everything proper
Your shit look chrome and your shit look copper
It's turning, homie, that's why you're turning on me
Admit it, I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public, I'm a cancer, man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe, niggas know who I am

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
You say you hustle like a hustle, I be moving the shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we counting the paper it better come back correct
Out in New Orleans, baby, niggas hungry for bread
Come throrugh that 9th ward stuntin' and get shot in your head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me, you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger, I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Yeah, I'm scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit, my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me, I'll be catching a case
New York a concrete jungle where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and you're dead, you'd be very afraid
I don't know how to behave, untamed fresh out the cage

Money make a pimp, pimp hoes
Hustlers sell dope, thugs gun smoke, what?
Money make the world go round as the world turns
Money make the world go round as the world turns

[Verse 1]
Nigga I need money to maintain, hustlin' ain't a game
Nigga go against the grain gon' get tore out the frame
TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs
I slang weed, cocaine and heroin
50 Cent, that's my name, nigga I bring the pain
You thought shit stay the same, nigga shit gon' change
Put a bullet in your brain, nigga at close range
Run away with ya rollie, your rings and your motherfuckin chain
Ain't nothing funny mang, I'm about my money mang
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playin
Better understan what I'm sayin what I'm sayin, I ain't playin
I'll be in front of your crib, layin, with the Mac to start sprayin
Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame
Crackers'll put ya in chains, box'll drive you insane
Sun can't shine all the time, man it's gotta rain
That ho loose as hell, you betta crack the whip, mang

[Hook]
A pimp ain't a pimp with no mothafuckin' hoes
A hustler ain't a hustler with no mothafuckin' dough
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke

[Verse 2]
I live life in the fast lane
Man I ain't got nuttin to lose, everything to gain
Either you with me or against me man ain't nuttin change
Nigga, you.. go against the grain, I'll make you.. walk with a cane
Now nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same
Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down wit a gang
O thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang
You got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang
Y'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich
They ain't even got to talk to take your bitch
One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o
She seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes
Ayo the bitch used to bring you dough, used to be your bottom ho
Now your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go
Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers
Politic with the willies the real shot callers

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I got one life to live, follow that light that keeps on guidin me
Haters tryin me, hoes is a-bidein me, media ride me
King of the Underground so the streets is steady hiding me
Representin sure tasters, the yay' keep takin pride in me
Streets Deciple slide-in me, status reports the badest
You caught walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport
I can't stay away like Too $hort, I gots to break a bastards back
Tore em up, get lem ready to port, put 'em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill, gorilla pimpin
If I have to mack ya wife then I will, it's me and 50 Cent
My nigga, live in trife, and thats real, talkin shit on us
Thats like pullin out a knife and dont kill, that's on the Trill
I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you
Without you even knowing got you strippin and even hoeing
You don't wanna let the pro in the door, this what we showin

[50 Cent]
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now it's time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine, bitch

[Outro]
Runnin from pimpin, bitch you need to run to some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on ho
You still ain't figured out what a ho supposed to look like

Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down

She was hesitant at first, said she never did it before
As soon as I got her going she was going like a pro
She went up and down like a merry go round
And round and round and splash
She's freaky freaky, when you get her in the bed
You need a G like me to get her to give you head
My conversation is stimulating
She in room ten-nineteen in the Hilton waiting
She got a thing for ballas, I mean a thing for balls
And I had turned her ass out so I'm the one she calls
On the cheek she kiss me and she tell me she miss me
Being around me got her used to drinking Don and Cristy
I'm a special nigga, look, I'm used to blinding
Keep that Benzo clean and those spreewells shining

Put me in your mouth and suck me off

(You can't be serious? It's four in the morning..)
Right in the morning I rolled over
Guess who was over my shoulder
A pretty round, round, round
Who just got finished going downtown
But at night with no lights I have you wondering
If it's a lighting bolt in your mouth or a glow-in-the-dark tongue ring
Banks need a ghetto chick, set a nigga up wit ass
Sneak around till he fall asleep, digging in his stash
Leave with everything, rob a Benz, stacks and the grass
Ass so fat she get handclaps when she pass
I ain't never had a girl, but you can be my bottom bitch
I done been around the world, we done hit all kind of chicks
Range Rover, never sober, Hennessey, vanilla soda
B-A-N-K dolla sign, bitch
Nah, I ain't here to hold you
Let your baby daddy roll his shoulder
Banks don't associate with no tricks
I'ma make it a G-Unit party, from the hotel lobby
And if you ain't trying to freak off then go home, bitch

Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off

You know what I came to do, let you put your lips on my dick
But don't tell nobody, you my mistress, bitch
All your friends keep telling you what to do when you get me
Got to eat the nuts first like a Hershey's Kisses
Bitch, show me you miss me like I'm Pac or Biggie
She can be small as Eve or even big as Missy
I like it when them dikes indugle in group six
Suck off thanks to 50 and B-Light, unit
Get your ass suplexed, telling me to go down
I'm a P-I-M-P, bitch, I bet you know now
Baby girl, slow down, ou make a nigga cum quick
When you closed your eyes and make your tongue do a twist
You my 3 o'clock, lolipop, kiss the last drop, bitch
Walk around naked, hoe, I met your ass topless
She finally found out what Young Buck is 'bout
So give a nigga from the south some of that mouth

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off

Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard

And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge

Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system

Just put a toe-tag on your mark

They got scared, sent that money, and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggas say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through and put my knife on that vein in ya neck (YEAH!)

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

[Non-stop]
(Yo, check me out right here yo)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yo, yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me, or I got to grab it
Don't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga
Ugly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke
You ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked
So the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards
I got no friends; fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm sliding through the Rucker, with Prada on the chuckers
So the spring break hoes home from college want to fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckers, cops following to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it come to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'ma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
Because my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run trains on them, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels
Got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery
Flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy
White tee burgundy, you match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:
Well, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;
You ain't going nowhere
Get yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}

Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
And blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)

[Lloyd Banks]
I been a problem since the old days, pimps and gold caps
Now I'm in O.J. Simpson throwbacks
Y'all was wonderin where my ass been
Probably vacationin on South Beach gettin head like an aspirin
If you gassed, I can let the tec pound your ego
Or lock you in a closet with the West Nile mosquito
The press crowd in people, especially celebrities
I'm heavily shittin on any Tom Dick or Gregory
Nigga you better be strappin; they want you dead if you rappin
I'm tryin to cave your head and your back in
I'm gettin bread and relaxin, and attractin a fan base
Of females with e-mails and letters to fax in
In Vegas with a toaster and a blunt
And the hotel I'm checked in, got a rollercoaster in the front
I'mma post 'em when I stunt, the Sammy Sosa of the month
Better yet the whole season, nigga I'm still breathin
Even though my dollars are green
I rap for the kids that's too poor to waste eggs on Halloween
I'm gettin swallowed clean, my habits are good
Collectin all the karats I could
Slidin from a stash spot to conceal the torture
And a good silencer to make it sound like the Wheel of Fortune
All this careless talkin, cause I'm travelin and flossin
Havin a good time, and you havin a abortion
You sucker for love, gettin married and divorced then
Can't even afford the batteries for your Walkman
I'm out the hood, burnin Cali weed on Slausson
Where set trippin turn to tragedies and coffins
Look, I mean what I'm sayin, you schemin I'm sprayin
Your team end up layin, on the sofa screamin and prayin
Sayin, G-Unit niggas be rollin crazy, holdin 80's
Older ladies starin cause they starin in that gold Mercedes
Since 50 hooked up with Shady, now they tryin to book up and pay me
If you think I'm shook up you crazy, baby
The boy strapped two ninas
Smokin out a bag big enough to fit on vacuum cleaners
I wore a glove when I blazed you fatty, I ain't your baby daddy
She flippin, now he tryin to grab me out the navy Caddy
I ain't your ave-y, papa was a rolling stone
Stockin up to own a home, pocket full of loaded chrome
Drop and get a hold of dome, I know your motive homes
You mad, cause I'm fuckin half your Motorola phone
I'm swift with the women I'm good with my words
A lot of, niggas is hatin on what I deserve I'm hotter
Front if you want, end up on the curb in your Prada
And your mans runnin, ambulance comin
Another day another dollar, on the low from the Impala
I can have a six still in my shower, motherfucker~!

Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move

It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say

No more freestyles and verses killing Sticky and Ja
I'm moving on now, I got bigger fish to fry
Since How to Rob, a lot of niggas been namin' names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas actin' like I don't get down or something
Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib
And you gon' ask dumb questions like, ""Can I live?""
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me, you're brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Tone and Poke, they better have my bail
But if its over a mil, don't put the crib up dun
Cause if fifty get free nigga, fifty gon' run

Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a poor no more
I ain't gotta steal from the corner store no more
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the floor no more
Bouncers don't try to play me at the dough no more
But when they see me, they say..
""Search him, he might have the nine""
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne""
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set
Me jumping out, 30 thou on my neck
And since you said it was nothing to sweat
You was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how, he reacts under pressure
Til Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me
Til the feds build a case or find files on me

But all I could do is cry
Silly, silly)

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend

Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1]
First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

Run when it spit, don't get hit by the AK
Take cover quick, niggas on that shit, ay
Come broad day they'll get at you with the AK

Niggas think they know me, I be on some other shit
My baby mama don't know me, I be with my other bitch
I blow a stack, I get it back, you keep in check, I get the gat
Then you wanna chitter-chat, now what kind of shit is that?
Strip club, shake it shake it, toss it up, make it rain
Semi tucked, I let it buck, I shoot the shit up out your gang
Find out who you're fuckin with cause I ain't for the sucker shit
Cut you like the cocaine, niggas stay in your lane
I'm a muh'fuckin heavyweight, you ain't in my weight class
And me I'm moving heavy weight, get gone with your light ass
Me I'm so official, pearl-handled nickel
Plated nine-nine, your life's on the line

I don't give a fuck who outside, now listen
I don't give a fuck who get hit, I ain't missin'
I come through that muh'fucker waving the chopper
113th Precinct ain't enough to stop us
Niggas shot at me before, I got away, popped from a block away
Sucker niggas be right there on one foot 'til I rock away
Next day I popped up told niggas it's my turf
They done seen the gun smoke, they done found my shells burn

Don't make me do it, I'll do it, you stupid nigga

They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation

[Chorus: Joe]
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

[Chorus: Joe]
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part

See me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long

That's when I start bringing them thangs out

Dumping clips off at their whole clique, mane

So when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane

I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run 'cause I'm behind ya
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line, bro
'Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum and they hate it
'Cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for
I represent it 'cause I'm in it
UTP until I'm finished, Juvenile, they can't stop us
And I admit it, I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper

Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

My twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me
When I come back around, man, I'ma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane
'Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't paying no fucking debt, mane
'Cause you's a middle man, what don't you understand?
You's a fucking fake ass connect, mane

Nigga, (yeah), nigga, you know I don't fuck with them niggas. Them niggas pussy. Sucka ass niggas. I don't like either one (I don't even like 'em). But the other night I'm in the gambling spot. Nigga come up in here - boom - hit the door. ""Get the fuck on the floor, bitch, get down on the floor."" I turn around like, ""what?"" Niggas like, ""get down!"" (When was this?) I'm like, ""nigga, I got on white linen.""

[Verse 1]
Okay, the dope addin' up, the coke addin' up
The smoke addin' up, my pockets are fattened up
I got bitches in my bedroom, nerds on computers
Diamonds 'round my neck, straps for my shooters
I made it, look ma', I made it
I grind so hard to get here I can't be faded
I got lawyers on the line, five different kinds
Five different crimes, same .45
Got a plan to turn to premise, see, a nigga ain't lyin'
Cause they ain't gon' say I did it and I ain't gon' say I did it
And I might go back and forth to court, better bet I get acquitted
Can you dig it? Nigga, can you dig it?
Shit changed, a nigga ain't broke
I had a safe size as a shoe box, it felt like a vault
Now I got real money, that ""fuck how you feel"" money
That ""nigga, you look at me wrong, get killed"" money

I peep my swag in the mirror, I think I got a crush on me
I don't want no wack bitches touchin' me
Tailor-made threads, satin sheets on my bed
Get a bitch sea-sick, waves all on my head
Diamonds in my ear, Baccarat chandelier
Gabbana underwear, I'm so fly it ain't fair
Every day a different dime piece
Rose Gold, a different time piece
Hublot, AP or rollie
Your bitch and your jeweler know me, homie
I'm bulletproof, go 'head, take a shot at me
You be a dead nigga like the last one that got at me
My shirt level three so I ain't got a vest on
My heart like ice, my chest like teflon
I'm a nightmare right here, just me and my knife, nigga
Don't let me find out you ain't 'bout that life, nigga
It's doomsday, I mean goon day

The mollies had a shorty ass trippin' strippin' in my kitchen
Push my thumb in her ass while I was strokin' her kitten
I be in my own zone, still clutchin' the chrome
Talk state of the art, you will see 'nine to foe
My passport need pages, I'm fuckin' round' out in London
Jetlag from jets, wrist lit baguettes
Trippin' in my charm, look bitch, I'm a don
So shit go how I say it go, fuck if I'm right or wrong
My paper long, bomb kush in the bong
It feels like I'm dreamin' cause a nigga on
I'm so far from a hammy down, I'm out in Miami now

She give me neck, what you expect? I got connects for the dope

Pit stop and they tend to quiet down
Cause they know about me

La la la… Yeah!
La la la la la la la la… Uh huh
Ooh I’d lie for you baby
Ooh I’d die for you baby
I like the way that feel

[Pre-Verse: 50 Cent]
I’ll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you’ll be around
Hold me down, I’ll build you up

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen, if you let me, I’ll be the reason you shine
It’s the secret, I want the world to know that you’re mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I’m writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon’ play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon’ stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I’m from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I’m special
Not rap, I mean me, that I’m special
You know they say diamonds are a girl’s best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I’ll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that’s a secret

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Baby, I build you up
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine
I need to know for sure
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I thinkin’ ’bout you thinkin’ that you feel the same way
Or is it just my imagination that get runnin’ away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c’mon, let’s roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let’s go
It’s hard to measure the pleasure of havin’ you in my presence
Your smile makes me smile, I’ll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I’ll pick out some shit
One pair at a time ’til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we’ll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it’s more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side there’s nothing I can’t do, yeah

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Baby…
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine
Build you up, baby, when you’re down
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
Cuz your smile, like a frown, yes I will
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine
I’m gon’ build you up baby

You ain't never heard a sound like this before
‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip ‘til every bubble in every bottle is gone

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa

Throw it up, one hand, wave back at the bitches
I'm silent, right before I snap I'm violent
I call myself the tussle, I'm the boss and the muscle
Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creeping through the fog, if you scared, get a dog
Get a male, because a bitch'll get you both in the morgue
Now peep the punchlines I'm punching these are knockout flows
I'm cyber pimping, I'm so new wave I got sci-fi hoes
This is next-level mack shit, that's why my money stack quick
12 V's V12 half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy envy, me
Your blinds blurring your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground, still gritty
Still running cities, Still Em, Dre and Fiddy, fuck with me
I'm an usual suspect when it's a hit
Turn up the volume and hear my voice, yeah it's the shit

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker

I had a five hundred bags, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about an hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggas go bizzurk, when the drought come get murked'
When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick
They say I'm grimmey, yeah fuck it I line niggas
I show them where your shit at before they take mine nigga (Hahaha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy today I'm tryin' to duck, I got that hover
I heard it'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave up and down you'd be like “I could just kill a man”
I don't fuck with them niggas from her projects
They're on section eight but niggas cars are straight
They ain't out in the day time them niggas roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the six four five hard top, not the drop
Leanin', I see them niggas schemin', dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would
I'll have my niggas deep, I have them light up they whole hood

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker

They said I fell off, my Benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggas spot start gettin' stuck (Shit)
I say ‘I ain't know none about nothing'
I'm on the low, niggas really know me for stuntin'
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsome, your bitch blowin' me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the misses, damn
I'm starting think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't gotta hold that for me
And slide by my baby momma crib with the mac on me
Man since her cousin in a car crash died
She said ‘don't drink and drive', I say ‘just drink, don't drive'
I had a morphine dream, I got heroine ambitions
That's big money cooking in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate I double up the cake (hey)

I'm comfy as hell, skatin with another nigga's money (WOO~!)
You lying your ass off; you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin your mask off, as soon as you act up (WHAT~!)
You know what I came for, a peace of the game or
Artillery that's 'bout as long as a chainsaw
I'm wide awake, but it still feels like I'm dreamin
40 cal' under my pillow condom feeling my semen
The physical presence of a female's the form of a demon
That's why I, fuck 'em and leave 'em get my nut while I'm breathin (YEAH~!)
Never thought they'd catch me slippin now I'm duckin and drippin
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you grippin
You trippin, no record can get my ass in position
Death waits for no religon whether catholic or christian
Listen; I went through momma bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause as poppa was in and out the prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect the odds
We got more four-fives and 9's then a deck of cards

You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)
Niggas hatin when you do good, but when you broke

Chi-Chi, get the llello (get the llello)
Picture me bein cracked, out of town trips on the train - WHAT~?!
Chi-Chi, get the Yayo
Picture me bein cracked... (TONY YA-YO!!!) here we go
You can sniff me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin country
Wall Street niggas, they cop me on a low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on a bus, the train, a plane
I'm smuggle, I'm nuttin but trouble
I'll make your money double, cook me in bakin soda
I'll turn your who-rock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill ya 'fridgerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
You can put me in the door panels or your stash box
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs and Reeboks
If you copped three and a half, you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin forwards (what?)
I'm tryin to move more birds, in P.A. all day
On the corner of 3rd - nigga what?!

[50 cent)
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (WHAT?!)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)

Picture me polishin pistols, I'm comin to get you, the shells hit you
You scream, think I'm playin - I mean it
Man I done brought all these pistols, let's get it poppin
Start to wavin my embroidered shell casings get to droppin
The devil's 'round the corner I got to much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket, just stunt and I'll pop it
I'm dyin to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you numbered for death
As the world turns, the lessons should be learned
Count all my blessings, clean up my weapons, I'm ready for war
The strong survive, the weak shall perish, I told you before
Hoes they compliment me now like 50 - nice chain!
Belagio, twenty grand of chips at the dice game
Ballin out, can't stop it, you gotta watch MTV
BET, nigga you see me~!!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin good
Or cause niggas feel me, more than you in yo' hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin and you don't bust your gat
You pussy!!

Yeah explain it to the niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin front nigga
Talk all that gangsta shit on the record; I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga; ask around in my hood nigga

I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot 100
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying ''fuck around and get clapped up''
I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin' pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin' I'mma catch a case

I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga's bidded, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so sidick
I cruise through, your bitch just fell in love with it
Baby, come in, girl, I want to give it to you
Once I'm in, it's on, I'm a freak with it
Money comes with it, hot shit, I spit it

I'm pissing on grown women, R Kelly do it to children
You bet against me, boy, I'mma hurt your feelings
Because over and over, I'mma keep on winning

You see a nigga soft? - My first instinct is to lean on him! (lean on him...)
A weak nigga eatin' in my hood? Niggas'll put a beam on 'em! (beam on him...)

Let these fake niggas get you in the mood for looove
I'm back to get you in the mood for the Snub and gloooves
Dope fiend, morphine, cocaine dilemma;
Crack come to cookin' up that; boy, I'm a chemist!
Fuck pill poppin'; a strap, I pop that!
Watch the Henchman trial, see a rat rat on a rat!
You got a nice gimmick goin', you've been hot a few summers
But I got the kinda flow that'll stop World hunger
SK, I got nothing but energy! (energy!)
Call me Fifty, call me ""Ferrari The Remedy""! (Remedy!)
""Hi"" again in case a hater don't remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas here pretend to be
Hittin' you won't be enough, you gotta finish me

I'm writin' reality, it sounds haaarsh;
Shyne tried to get at me, he say I'm waaashed!
I ain't even fire back, the shit's squuaashed
What kind of shit is that? - This only happens in rap!
These niggas so fake, it make my skin craaawl
Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the waaall
Ice chunks in the chain, - weight spinnin'
Cream linen. - Bulges from the Benjamin's in 'em!
Tom Ford? - Oh, Looord!
If I ain't know better, I think a nigga push raaaw
It feels like it's never gon' stop
A nigga so hot! - I may spend forever on top!

Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam

Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
Got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some ""get this money"" shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DEA I sold dope in VA
My coupe stay in Queens but the plates read VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on consignment
(Hey, times is hard man) I know, don't remind me

Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

That's my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go, I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog
You know a bitch don't usually mean nothing to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful screaming ''I hate you''
She must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, with me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fucking with you

Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya

In the back of the club big tipping

She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby, you was confused
I had a thing for you, I had a ring for you
House, cars, kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat, told you I'd make it, you ain't believe
I guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you
It's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends
I guess I'm like Will Smith in ""Pursuit of Happyness""
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think, just think, that could've been you
Now just think that should've been you with me

I'm going out of my head

Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm exhausted, last night I lost it
Let the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit
Nana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood
Got an infection, the cycle of life just sucks
I bet when he die, she die, just because
They been together 60 years, that's what they call love
Paid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand
Then two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man
I woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself
Thought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself
My cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head
Before I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid
My head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets
And it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it
My mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie
I might need a straitjacket fit for me

My favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar
Had complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver
To me he’s still the man cause see me I still remember
That lil’ snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December
I was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft
Even with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass
I got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him
He can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him
Called my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone
And Banks, me and him don't even talk no more
You know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack
Never used no knife or had to squeeze no strap
But if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound
For cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds
Home invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house
Took them niggas paper and all of they packs out

It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Then I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim
Looking at Proof like, ""How much you think this gon' cost them?""
Feels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me
I rather a nigga just put a knife in me
Than go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions
Never die down in my head, they keep going
It feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions
Amazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite
I never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade
When life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade
My nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch
Life without my old girl, I couldn't see that
My grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down
I looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'ma gon' go to now?
That was his partner, see he knew everything about her
Now he's saying he don't wanna live without her

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy

Who wanna got chopped? who wanna get shot?
Who wanna get these Cristal bottles smashed all across they knot?
Dupe, I run wit' grimey niggas that's down to tear the club up
You run wit' dirty niggas that wash and tear the tub up
My niggas get knocked wit'out Glocks, there go the shop

Yo, yo in the local club niggas stay gettin' hit
All they do is clean up the blood, change the name and reopen the shit
I watch niggas sip cups and cherish Hennessy as they hard
They get drunk, then they wanna thump

Ice on the wrist, big as the shit Titanic hit
Now shorties in my hood sayin' they like my style
Hoes in Hollywood sayin' I'm too wild
I'm gettin' plenty paper, my head is still nappy
I'm still plottin' to pop police like Pappy
Mason, niggas clearly don't understand what they facin'
Let them get outta line then I have to lace them
They runnin' for they life then I have to chase them
And let shot off in bump-a-clot head
Style's awesome, ain't it?
The flow's flawless, flip like a cordless jack
Applaud this black, this ain't ya average rap

My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her

I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-not's turn into Sasquatch

And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter

It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply

I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me

These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me

Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Ain't shit they could do to me
Still rocking, still rolling
We holding, bill folding, you know it
When I start to ball out money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle

"[Intro]
Ayo, I know these niggas don't like me
But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm saying?
50 cent, 9-9, motherfucking Doo Wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wanna take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)

[Verse 1]
Yo, they shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll 'em over, take that Pelle Pelle
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even Puff and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm saying this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son, I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rapping niggas dying to shine
And I'm tired of fiends asking for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punchline from me may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo, the sale went stale, caught 'em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man indictment, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an O.Z
My man brought 'em to me, see he ain't really know, B
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just trying to prop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him O.Z.'s then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-d's -- damn man, I O.D
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holding the heat
Po-po walking to beat, we burning L's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over, I can't believe it, damn it's over
Feds seized the Six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rolling in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
.380 six-shot Glock top loader
Keep it in my waist, son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga, so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfucking marathon

[Outro]
Come on, bounce, nigga, bounce
Wop the reason why y'all motherfuckers say bounce, bitch
Niggas, niggas don't set trends, niggas just jump on dicks
That's why they Bloods and Crips now",50 Cent,Doo Wop Freestyle,
"[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Yeah
It is what it is, son, niggas can’t stand it
It’s my fifth lap, a nigga been round and round the planet
Shorty said ‘Welcome to Miami'
Her friends sayin 'Welcome to Miami'
Jet-skies, the yacht, the hawk in the backyard
Back to back Porshes, a nigga go that hard
I love money, nigga this is drug money
Laundromat, spin cycle, make it snow money
Beef nothin’ to a nigga, nigga I’m comfy'
Throw a hundred racks on a bitch, I told ya she want me
If I want the ho, I get the ho, fuck the ho then forget the ho
Let a ho be a ho, play the pimp, pay the rent
I’m a fly nigga on or off, yeah I buy fly shit
Presidential rolly nigga tell me now, can you buy that?
I’m the biggest nigga Southside seen since Fat Cat
I tell a nigga suck a dick quick cause I’m strapped back

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I make it double up, few blocks of raw
I, I, I did it, I got to get more
I make it double up, baking soda galore
Till we in Bentleys and mansions with marble on the floor
I make it double up
Aye bring me that pyrex
Get the baking soda, the ice
I'mma show you how you do this shit
You think I don’t know what I’m doing but I know what I’m doin

[Verse 2 - Hayes]
We on the other side of the border chilling with drug lords
Tryin put a order in during the drug wars
Jay said this is what happens when you disrespect one of us
And cut a muhfucka head off right in front of us
That’s when I said i’m going back to cali
My man said he going back to cali
I know some Mexicans in Arizona I’m cool with
I’d rather slang that than come and deal with this bullshit
‘cause I ain't gonna budge
Pay me or die g, dog, it ain't no love
Niggas know who they owe
My number ain’t changed bitch
Front door service put one in your brain quick
Could've put it right in your chest close range shit
Watch you die slow let you know who you playin' with
Fuck all that swearin' to god, promise and prayin' shit
I ain't a big sob story fan, I'm spraying shit
12 gauge, AR-15, AK'n shit
Passenger seat's gon' get killed, I'm sayin' this princ-i-pals
We don't draw the line at drug dealing, we crim-i-nals
Goin' all out
Before I say you played me I’ll go in ya'll house
And get killed there or blow your fucking brains out
You gotta bring your ass to get some
You gotta make cash to spend some
And I ain’t a victim mothafucka

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about fronting
Think about stunting when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet ski's slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine
Come on, let's ride

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?""
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Verse 3: Governor]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm dreaming big, real big, I got big dreams
I'll kill 'em this year, I got big schemes
It's bigger than coke, it's bigger than dope
My marijuana mentality went up in smoke
I go hard, so hard there ain't nothing harder (yeeeahhh)
Poor or rich, my nigga, I hustle regardless
'Til I die and touch the sky
I'll be trying to get my piece of the pie
Shoot me or love me or hate me or leave me alone (c'mon)
The jealousy's growing 'cause I'm in the zone (yeah)
The underground king, I'm on the throne
'Cause niggas just ain't on the shit that I'm on

It sounds like murder on the instrumental (yeah)
I tend to spaz, I went through cash
So fast got to get me some more

Now that I have you I don't know what to do

Same color your Air Force Ones
White on white, ya like?
Red I Flight the night
From L.A. to N.Y
I'm Harlem bound
You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round
Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club
But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs
I hear 'em whispering "" dat ain't a man, shit that's her.""
She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up
I got a fetish for the chips
20's for the six
Hollows for the clips
Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch
And the police we'll have another crime scene taker
Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake

Now get the fuck on the floor
I slid through the front door
With the 9 and the velour
A cal in my pocket
You wil', I'mma pop it
I'm down for a profit
I'm ghetto as hell
You can't you tell?
My road dog, under the jail
Getting frustrating mail
So I'm drinking and smoking
Thinking and hoping
This cell gon' open
You can dance next to me, but don't throw an elbow
I'll throw one back and leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no
I ain't paying for pleasure
Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
Long on the suine
DVD's on the screen
Blowing on cream
Waiting for you to scheme
You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine

I don't wanna grow up, I'mma hustler kid

I'm artistic, intelligent, so much ability
When I use them big words, your bitch be feeling me
So ya'll niggas hate me, cause your wives be our groupies
Ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies
Fall back, matter fact back down
Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P
So my pockets never be empty
It ain't no problem, we scoop them models
We got condoms, coups, and lavish condos
50 got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club, hoes love the kid

I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the Fire Marshall come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed everytime I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and 2Pac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent

You wanna party, let's party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna creep we can creep tell me where should we meet

Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney
Man, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty
Why's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?

That just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me
Niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you ""my dad's fucking crazy""
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die

So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face

The Hoover Crip, I grew up on Figg I had to dodge them County Blues
Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face

It's eight class karats in the border
I poke ho's in plastic to avoid a vaginal disorder

Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, ""baby I apologize""
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Mattola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny

Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow

I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar

[Intro]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 1]
When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again",50 Cent,Ghetto Qu’ran (Forgive Me),

It ain't my fault, you can't break it down

Listen, you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin' through life chasin' my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah

Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

So I switch up whips to stay off the radar

Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call: ""Fifty what up?""
""They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up""
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven

[Verse 3]
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you  in CASAT
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens
But when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his and it might be yours
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers
You can have them on their back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell

Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
'Cause I get tired of looking for ya
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me

[Chorus]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

[Verse 2]
My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride 'till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains

[Chorus]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

[Bridge]
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me (best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me (testing me)
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me (blessing me)
Finna run rap 'cause Dr. Dre got the recipe (recipe, recipe)

[Outro]
Yeah, ha ha, aye Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
'Cause the windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof, nigga

But better that than a hole in the head right, nigga? Ha ha ha ha",50 Cent,Heat,

Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla, ""Roll up!""
Then I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money
You ain't smoking in my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls, Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris

Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that lye, lye-lye-lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit!""
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I could go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me
Who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit

Now my baby she precious, I warn you not to test us
I aim her at your head, nigga, motherfuck the vests
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I got her on me
I'm riding with her on cocked, Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow, twist the indo, smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up when we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I done went legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self and my back, God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics

We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on

We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds
But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one
Used to do graffiti, now look we major
Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor
Re-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure coca leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money coming in like we run the streets

We came from nothing, now they saying we straight

Hold on

This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?
Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined
We don't want your block, just cop your work from us
Those niggas you call allies can't be trust
That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid
Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again
When it's war, it'll be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
That sneaky nigga spray that Semi at your momma crib
With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit

The bottom line is: I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell, I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
""Dance your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan, tell him, ""Tell your man""
Mason Betha, haha
Come up off that watch now, I mean right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB, but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What, Jigga just sold like four milli, got something to live for
Don't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like ""Dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no mo', where you getting chips from now?""
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah for real, son, I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh four hundred pounds, how he gonna catch me, son?

I'll catch P and Silkk the Shocker right after the Grammys
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like, ""You, give me the cash; you, put the hot dog down""
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D.? ""Fuck you, pay me!""
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down, well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroners picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw you
He said ""Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for ya""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all, he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
One at a time, get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor

I express myself so the question I'm askin' (aaoow!)

Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, ""Look at Niggaraci"" - hello

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)",50 Cent,Hustler’s Ambition,

That you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When the album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a female holmes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones

I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused

Somewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise
Oops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze

I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me

Yeah, it is what it is man
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Sirens flashin' you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', cross full of diamonds he bought grindin'
His foot slip off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, askin' niggas if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anythin' that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, every time it's on

[Chorus]
I tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'

(What? Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin' problem nigga?)
(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)

[Verse 2]
Niggas be talkin 'bout me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them OG niggas, they stuck in the 80's
Sayin they gon' do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire
I prevents runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on the barbed wire
This shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?
Thought you was fucked up, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter fact, you's a buster
I don't trust ya, I should send niggas to touch ya

I tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em

Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas try and lay me down wit heat
And if I should die though before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

[50 Cent]
If dead men could talk in your sleep your homey told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? (Huh?)
Or would you start switchin upv
You thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?
What if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong
All jux'll get your money long but look here I'm gone
Would that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?
Would that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?
What if he gave you a little list of things to do?
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load the gats, and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze
Your homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!

Them boys smoked your homey, ye ain't gon' do nuttin back?
Not even if he told you you next to get clapped?
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples gon' probably cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this 1-8-7?
When you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain
You gon' try and tell God you've been framed?
Y'all did everything together, he was your dog
Now you Uptown coppin, and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave packs to, they kept the cake
His sister and his baby momma talkin to Jake (uh-huh)
Niggas that rocked him, they came to the wake
But they ain't come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide all in the buisness
Walkin 'round askin niggas to tell 'em who did it
Niggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggas are animals, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga'll body somethin over a bundle

I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop 9's
Tell niggas get they money right, 'cause I got mine
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump – is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone

'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking what happened
Oh no, look who clapped 'em with the .44
20 inch rims sitting on Low-pro's

Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit – we get it popping in the hood
G-Unit – motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act

Go 'head, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, ya heard me?
When streetlights come on, niggas blast the 9's
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's ups and downs so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the drop-out who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it

I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say or I do
When I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next morning saying bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me
That I'm no trick, I'm no sucker, I'm no chump

It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind, make my old nine shine
Like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years

She like the kid, my lifestyle what she wanting
Bottle after bottle by the bar, I be stunting
It's Gucci this, Gucci that, Gucci hat
Big doofy gat, hit you in your kufi hat
You know me, I told your ass in '03 ""Get Rich or Die""
G-5 I fly, write my name in the sky
Pick an island on the map, I been to it
Shorty wanna try anal, her friends do it

Say something slick out your mouth I'll come for your head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'mma get to heaven in this lifetime
Is right below her waist in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her

You write hot lines like mine lines you're signed

She used a vibrator and she suck on your boy

It's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing
For me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines
An old timer schooled me, said: ""Don't burn bridges, my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim""
I watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York

A thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality

Here's a jewel: love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same, friends always change
I learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat
You can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back
All bullshit aside now, its time to be honest
I fear no man, for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit
From '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit

You said what?!
It’s over boy!
It’s like a Murder Inc clearance sale…

[Chorus]
Ask about me
They’ll tell you I’m an animal, an animal
You touch one of mines I’ll react like an animal, an animal
They say I have no conscience
I’ll kill if I have to, y’all
They say I’m an animal
Sometimes a nigga cross the line and he got to go
Move on him like an animal

Nigga don't talk to me if you ain't in my bracket
100 mil, that's 60 after taxes
I was a little dirty nigga flipping my mattress
Sneakers fuck up til I started pumping packs, kid
Beefin' with the older niggas getting my ass kicked
Bought a little .380 I stopped all that shit
Back on that bullshit you know I’ve been on
Riding with the same 9 Tre used to kill Bon
Niggas dead serious, niggas though we was playin
Picture me laughing in the crib after Tre shot Wayne
Southside ain't southside without the team
Niggas starving I feed em they'll ride for me
When feds come, nigga shit gets funky
Irv love Preme he fittin' to be his bunkee
In a park full of kids, I pop of the mack
They see the flare from the nozzle and scatter like rats
I know the police is listening, this is for the D's
Me and Star was cool & I ain't hit Cheese
Signed a deal and made a mil before Bags got shot
Made 20 more 'fore Tah-Tah got knocked
Man this rap shit is me B, I got this locked
Treat it just like the block workout non-stop
I dazzle with the footwork, maneuver with the heat
Think boy or get your brains left in the street
Yeah the Stick-up Kids say it’s out the tax
But I get your shines back for you homie, relax
I send my little shooters right at 'em with Gats
Hit 'em so hard they gonna send that back
You know I know who ran up in your crib
The first thing they do is holla at the kid
They say 50 fucked with us man, we poor need work
They need niggas like us to do their dirt

[Chorus]
Ask about me
They’ll tell you I’m an animal, an animal
You touch one of mines I’ll react like an animal, an animal
They say I have no conscience I’ll kill if I have to, y’all
They say I’m an animal
Sometimes a nigga cross the line and he got to go
Move on him like an animal

[OUTRO]
Yeah
Nigga what?!
Get a good look nigga!
See the flash of my diamonds and shit nigga!
Hahaha
Ridin back since this shit cost more than yo momma house
You’re fucking playing with me nigga?
I came up hard nigga!
You already know what I’m about!
What?! Hahaha…
Aye
Aye tell Preme
That if he send me a written apology
We can squash this shit
Naaww nigga…we ain’t squashing this shit",50 Cent,I’m An Animal,
"[Intro]
Yeah
Feels good

[Verse 1]
I might be the crookest nigga movin' around with 3 felonies
I get a laugh at all the bullshit niggas be tellin' me
My hood full of niggas like Marky and Bill Bellamy
Them funny niggas will get ya, so keep the heat with ya
It's Ferrari
Nigga, my name hold weight, like a diesel nigga on a bitch pressed up state
Here's my number, 94R6378
In case you thought the shit I say in my line's fake
I make a mess in the mess hall - cause a brawl
Caught you catchin' no charge; oh God
Why's my life so hard?
Cause I ain't book-smart, they think I'm a retard
No, I dont know much about the French I talk
All I know is when that drama pop off, these pussies is shook
This is Rikers Island pain talk; your phone time’s my chalk
My time is my time, and your time's mine, punk
Cut you from ear to ear, [?]

I'm a rider
Wherever I'm in or out, I'm me

Whether I'm locked or I'm free
Whatever I'm at, I'm who I be
You know you wanna be a rider like me

[Verse 2]
Any nigga with a glass jaw gotta get his shit cracked
Soon as I touch the bricks, I bust a clip and take the strip back
Give me [?] money for a week; I could flip that
They had my face while I'm juxin' you when I push your shit back
[?] used to carry billy clubs, Trey-eight slugs
Now they carry nines but I got hollows in mine
I see my homies on the corner, burnin' a dutch
Take a [?]; next thing you know, I'm [?] fucked up
Every Tuesday I'm in parole, listenin' to niggas
Lyin' through they teeth 'bout how they holdin' fingers
You make police contact? (Nope)
Stayin' out of trouble? (Nope)
Got a job yet? (Nope)
I'm still sellin' dope
I'm just playin' [?]
Let me piss in a cup
And I got shit I gotta do; you really fuckin' me up
See you, I could talk to you; you know what's up
All that drug program shit be slowin' me up

[Chorus]
I'm a rider
Wherever I'm in or out, I'm me
Whether I'm locked or I'm free
Whatever I'm at, I'm who I be
You know you wanna be a rider like me

Shh... quiet... you hear that?
What the fuck, son?
I'm telling you, man, you gotta watch these niggas

[Chorus]
I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat

[Verse 1]
We thought the coke and the dope would help us escape poverty
When that didn't work we resorted to armed robbery
Yeah, I done it, but I ain't the one they said did it
Before my first verse my Benz had been kitted
I'm so hood, that's what the bitches like about me
She bob and weave, she up and down, she suck the life up out me
I tell you 'bout my regimen, I blow a stack stunting
The coldest shit I'm on it, kid, I'll blow a nigga fronting
I'm dirty, yeah, I do that dirt, I'm down to put that work in
I kick the door to get them bricks, that Eagle get to chirping
You see that beam on ya head, nigga leaking
Yeah, screaming and shit, man, shut the fuck up

[Chorus]
I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat

I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat

[Verse 2]
I had a dream niggas got me
Woke up, a nigga shot me
I ain't slept in three days
My eyes red, something wrong with my head
The MAC stashed right under the pillow on my bed
It's not hot, why the fuck am I sweating?
My heart beating, I'm bugging, I wreck it
Bitch, don't move, it's dark, I might panic
Just sit still, I mean it, God damn it
My back against the wall
Fuck the world, I'll kill 'em all
Ain't a nigga too big or too small
Chop 'em down, watch 'em fall
Watch 'em bleed, watch 'em crawl
Watch 'em bleed 'til they gone

[Chorus]
I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat

Put one under my pillow, one under my seat

I can't even fucking sleep (I'm paranoid)
Bitch, quit playing, hand me my heat (I'm paranoid)
I can't even rest my head (I'm paranoid)
I'm fin to leave me a nigga dead

Ah-ha man! Ayy you know where them niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin' (Uh-huh), straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 1]
This is not new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight

We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'

[Verse 2]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, ""Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall,"" I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah!

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)

And I'm thinking it can all work out
Seen your bitch back blown out

She talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town
Not around, she want me to fly in to put it down

'Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular
Turn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass
You know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)

You get hit with AK round, your ass ain’t gon’ make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I’m from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you’re on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load

Gimme a second I’mma holla, I’mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood

[Verse 2]
I don’t trust a muh’fuckin soul
When the D’s come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I’m from it ain’t safe to have more than a eighth
Niggas’ll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo’ case
Co-operate, or Doc’ll have to operate
Niggas I’ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas’ll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you’ll have to catch ’em and merk ’em
I’m observing in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I’m a hustler, how the fuck I’m ’sposed to eat when it’s hot?

The house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that’s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggas where I’m from don’t wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain’t good to do good in my hood

We ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit
I want the bread, you want the bitch
Come out your mouth slick I'll get you hit
My niggas hungry, they hit a lick
Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a A1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off, man, anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
If you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?

Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt
Pussy your whole life, you always been a bird
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves
And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible
Nigga, you vaginal

Money for bail, money to bail
Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell

Kept fate when all hope fail

Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'
Stankin' like shipments, over my shillings

The walls have ears lil' nigga, I run New York
Even when I ain't there lil' nigga, I run New York

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I wake up, stare at the ceilin'
I'm alive, what a beautiful feelin'
I put my vest on right after I put on my drawers
It's a habit I'm always prepared for war
See my life's like some shit, you seen in a flick
Bitches act like pornstars when they sit on a dick
When I was hit and out the game I said ""one more flick""
Test my aim in the range I'm like ""one more clip""
It's my brain, I'm insane, I be on some shit
Man I run Interscope, Jada's tryna annoy me
Nuthin' but another disgruntled employee
He been in the game ten years and he still ain't rich
Even his mama upset that he still ain't shit
And he keep runnin his yap, like I'ma take all that
One more word out his mouth I'll push Style's shit back
See the nozzle on my tre pound is three inches long
And the trigger on the fo' fo's extremly strong
With a little tre douche is like pop, pop
Chase his ass up the block til his bitch ass drop
And the verses he be kickin' none of 'em hot
Cos he ain't got none of that shit he says he got
And he ain't did none of that shit he said he did
And I ain't got time to be talkin 'bout this shit, (fuckin' faggot)

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I guess it's easy to see lil' nigga, I run New York
Yeah I live in CT lil' nigga, but I run New York
And I don't go to parties lil' nigga, but I run New York
And I stay gettin cheese lil' nigga, cos I run New York
(Yayo, tell 'em I run New York)

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
My gun is longer than yours, nigga, call your recouster
LOX made more money than them thin tiny suits
The game around south, drugs and rappin
Jada fuckin punchlines, my serp went platinum
Style's and Sheek Louch went double plastic
Yayo, Buck and Banks was puttin out classics
A hundred shots, a hundred clips, y'all ready to die
Fat Joe ain't a gangsta, he scared to fly
Automatic mossberg, who want a piece of this punk
I had Ja Rule buryed in some high heel punk
Feds stuck in a bullet-proof, man fuck that
Homie, shoot up my whip, you only leave a scratch
Yo, I slip cocaine, in your hotel lobby
And beat you wit my pistol like Caine did Chauncey
It's T.O.N.Y.Y.A.Y.O.,

I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
From the cordless cell phone in baby blue drop
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street
These industry niggas are startin' to look like something to eat
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
My niggas living on section eight in public housing
They'll murder you and keep the shit low cause niggas heard of you
Them b-more niggas is rowdy rowdy
Them Detroit niggas is bout it bout
If they say they gonna kill ya nigga don't you doubt it
Got your gun well don't leave home without it


[Verse 3]
Yo, your man could have ran when I robbed him but he froze
Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she chose
Now you heart broke, that's what you get for lovin' them hoes
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid
Runnin round without no heat, it's like a fifth with no kick
A fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
A bad bitch that won't blow dick
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin' spot with no dice
Like fuckin' supermodel bitches and not bustin' off twice
I murder any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice
I only say things once, never twice, don't fuck with me",50 Cent,Look What You Made Me Do,

Aw!
It hurts
The D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me

[Verse 1]
You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down

[Hook]
Police get in the way, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder them
I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder them
You see I told you I'd murder them

[Verse 2]
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

See me, I never ever ever run
Niggas say the wrong shit to me like he wanna do me
Somebody be at him with my gun
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world

[Verse 1]
Listen, nigga you play me and I'mma go crazy
You push me I'mma motherfucking trip
I come tripping through your set busting off my TEC
I gives a fuck if you's a Blood or a Crip
Nigga from J.F.K. to L.A.X., I'm back through the sets again
Gangsta life, that's right, crazy-ass Mexicans
Do it the raw way, broad day, AK
Spray cause a melee, mayday mayday
Freak bitch suck me on tape like Ray J
Niggas that I'm up against know they can't fade me
I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wanna come, bitch, bring your ass on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See, I come from the Southside where niggas is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggas say they gon' see me to hit 'em on G.P
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinking ""man, ain't this a bitch?""
Niggas stick cola in cola, from moving the yola
Next thing you know they up in your crib
Saying ''where's the stash at?'' You move they gon' blast that
So I suggest you stand still, kid

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)

Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Somethin' wrong with the bitch (fuck that bitch)

Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
The money gonna make you sell your soul

Whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then alright
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons
Talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
You got a smile that only a fool would forget
And a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
Buggin' cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
She wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
But on the sidewalk we ain't play games
We exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' ""I know that nigga, he rich""
She think I got six whips cause me and my Man switch
Anyway, her name is CeCe
She said she go to BMCC
Push a '98 328 with chrome BBS
She said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
She liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me

Type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
They into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls

Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
Oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
Nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
Platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
That I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
Know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
Probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
Long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
It goes on and on and on and it don't stop

[Chorus]
Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?

One thing you can always count on is change
And a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
Had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
Would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
Now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
While we on the 900 double R Hondas
Watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
While Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
All these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
You can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
Take 'em two at a time
Quick I get in they mind
Have 'em thinkin' they mine
Bust off then tell 'em ""Bust a Uey, on mo' time""
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year

Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit
A shoot out in 89' fucked up how he walk
He a grimey ass nigga, you should hear how he talk
Should shoot the shepard in the head and da sheep ill scatter
Let niggas talk cause action is all that matters
I asked about Barnes he sucked his teeth and said he was soft
Said the boys up in Otisville was breakin him off
Can you picture him in the yard, niggas yokin him up
Treatin him like a pin cushion, pokin him up
He came home actin like he hard as fuck
Must want a first class ticket to see god Uh huh

It's on when he come home cause he can get 'nuff bricks
I was young he taught me not to run, I popped my gun par

They embedded in my brain young crime does pay
New Cadillacs and Bonnevilles the very next day

Fuck a headlock, im talking bout extortion nigga
Apply pressure, its hot, get the fuck out the kitchen
When niggas pay you every Friday you ain't got to stick em

Started a pyramid, the nigga took the money and ran
Heard he was outta town ridin round in the pound
Chrome spinnin' 545 I no lie ask how
Out on VA, Hampton homecoming he cruise by
He run in to the niggas that he beat, he gon die

With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DT's ringin doorbells, goin door to door
Yo I'm stressed out, smokin bogie after bogie
Duckin the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit

How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev, P-Low, Big Jewel the Kid
And my man 50 used to smack a bitch

From NY to Compton real respect real
One hand on the wheel, one hand on the steel
Roll that, pass that, cock that, blast that
Flip that, flash that, I'm always where the cash at
That's why I'm in a nigga crib screaming where the stash at
Nigga come up with the chips and get hit
This is that beretta bounce, that full clip sound
That six shot revolver dance, now spin around
Anyday gunplay, friday, monday
Strawberry sunday 'll light up your Hyundai
Your hoopty hit up, you ain't dead get up
Nigga, one to the git-ut, 'll hurt more than your sit ups
It's nasty it's foul right, this is what my style like
Bang Bang, G-Unit's the gang, man
I reload and unload, I explode
On the track I'm more addicting than crack, better yet to smack
I'll take you higher and higher 50 is fire, word to Maniyah
This is just the beginning, I'm not done winning
Pray the lord keep me from sinning, the shit that I been in
Got me ready to squeeze and breeze, fuck the d's
Niggas spit bars, but they not like these
This is that porsche carrera Ferrari F-50 flow
The type shit that bring flocks of hoes
Can you feel it, I make you feel it
I'll have the hood in a frenzie on some real shit
You rocking with the don dada, the blood clot charters
Follow orders, they treat me like I walk on water
I'm the tapdance king when I come to the bricks
I get to steppin in the name of love and shit
Trust me, this is not what they expected
The kid back around to wreck shit
Niggas reline em, the wolves 'll find em, the jewels 'll blind em
The unit be shining like no other motherfucker

Thug niggas in the street saying I'm sonnin' you
Dude I'll smoke you and every motherfucker under you

From now on, when I speak, y'all niggas better listen
Why run against a thoroughbred when you ain't in no condition
Still got shit on ya nose, from all that ass you been kissing

Punk niggas I'm sonnin' 'em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin', dial 1-800-TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
Cause when I stick you, you gon' cough it up like you bulimic
I'm no magician, but I could make, somethin' outta nothin'

Crackers tried to lynch me, but couldn't get me cause I'm real smart
Heart of a lion, what that mean? I got a big heart
Certified in style, been like that since a lil' boy
Nigga, who you talking to? You know what I'll do to you
Transvestite your bitch-ass, make you work out in a hula hoop
Street king, Boosie, boo, did things that turn you Christian
Let it burn, fuck the consequences, what you saying? I'll burn you
Bitches to the ground with no mercy, I promise you
From Baton Rouge to Cashville, niggas gon' ride for Boos'

Got tats all on my body, my paperwork coming back clean
Me and Boosie just tryna help B.G. get through his fourteen
I don't want liquor, I just want lean, I caught two bodies on four beams
I gotta slow down (fuck that shit, we home now), well nigga, nigga, nigga
It's going down, point 'em out and I'mma point blank it, point blank
I will have you emptying everything you have in your bank
Bitch, I ain't get no visits, I just done my time, ho
Bought your bitch so many bottles turned into a wino
Stomp a nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga ass out in these Giuseppe's
All my bitches on par, all my niggas got felonies
Don't do that, you ain't 'bout that, you don't sell that, you don't count that
You might grew up being around that, you weren't there where we was gettin' down at

I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga

[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
Even my P.O., she called me ""the Ginger Bread Man""
I catch a new case, and tell her ass: ""Catch me if you can""
Don't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper
There's no place like home, New York! New York!
I run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!

"[Chorus: 50 Cent & Kidd Kidd]
Niggas be schemin', fiendin'
To cut your jooks, take off the hook
I come through there, look how they look
I'm ridin' leanin', they dreamin'
They do me dirty if they could
I'm lookin' like I wish you would
Try me, go 'head, try me
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'
Try me have you hooked to I-V
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Mad niggas wan' do me dirty, I'm fresh out the tub
You move like a snail you deserve to catch a slug
Man I wake up huggin' my bitch
One with that extended clip, not the one that I'm with
If you all made man, then you know shit real
They got change on Lil Mike, I ain't trynna see him killed
I told 'em that's my cuz, I don't wanna see nothin' happen to him
Cause when I start spittin' at 'em, I ain't rappin to 'em
Now I'm jumpin' in that water like a diver
Six shot survivors, school of hard knock scholars
These niggas ain't riders, they hiders, they cowards
I feel like 50, hold power of a dollar
I told my nigga give me one of them bullet-proof trucks
I want you dumb enough to try and shoot it up
I'm lookin' at the nigga lettin' off
Wait until you finish the clip, laugh then pulled off

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Kidd Kidd]

Try me have you hooked to I-V
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
It sounds like a nightmare, I graduated from fightin'
Play the projects faster than the 32 man indictment
See my baby blue Ferrari make 'em feel like the virus
In they stomach, I keep it one hundred, I make 'em vomit
I got a code name for straps, sacks in the trumpet
I get to blowin', the ears will ring for days when I dump it
My bullet wounds call 'em beauty marks
And my ho we don't talk to narcs
So the first 48 the clock tickin', the plot thickens
The charge, cocaine possession, I'm creepin' with a firearm
The D's don't even wanna see me, with a firearm
Before I go back again, I'mma let it off
They ain't got to pop first, fuck that I'mma set it off
I need a mental eval, somethin' wrong with my brainwaves
I'm rich as a motherfucker still ridin' with a AK
Picture me comin' through lettin' a nigga play me
When I got all this bread, bitch it's off with ya head, ASAP

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Kidd Kidd]
Niggas be schemin', fiendin'
To cut your jooks, take off the hook
I come through there, look how they look
I'm ridin' leanin', they dreamin'
They do me dirty if they could
I'm lookin' like I wish you would
Try me, go 'head, try me
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'
Try me have you hooked to I-V
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I had to be slippin' to let this clown hit me up
Now I gotta walk around with this shit bag for months
Now I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch or a nigga
Startin' to treat my own brothers like they just another nigga
My clique got smaller and my clips got bigger
Condom on my heart, motherfuck your feelings
They call me Superman see I ain't supposed to walk
Better watch how you talk or get popped like a cork, off

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
See they ain't real as they seem and they schemin'
They fiendin' and dreamin', they geekin' and creepin'
They hear tires screechin', infrared beamin'
Niggas head leakin', what the fuck was he thinkin'?
Sounds of police, momma signin' new leases
You know you got to relocate her when you beefin'
I guess you're here for a real reason
Rah got hit like you got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

I come through there, look how they look

It's 50 Cent starring as Game, it's autobiographical
I hope you enjoy yourselves

[Verse 1: 50 impersonating Game's voice]
50 callin me crazy, I might be just maybe
I'm gangsta I'm crippin', the Damu I'm trippin'
Fuck 50, fuck Dre, fuck N.W.A
Man I'm Hurricane Game (Em this nigga changed)
I brought the west back I write the best raps
(But what about Snoop?) Snoop shit ain't all that
And I get bad bitches now I even fucked Mya

See that's why I hate you, you think you know me
I'mma tell everybody you shot my homie
I hope the police get you and you go to jail
Feds freeze your accounts so you can't make bail
Hope everybody on G-Unit go to hell
Wit Eminem, Obie, Stat Quo and D-12
So what I was on change of hearts so what I was a stripper
So what I never banged I'm from Compton nigga

So what, it's still on my trophy case I think nothing of it

Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies?
And why you don't sit and stroll through your memories?
Why is the question I ask
Shit was all good when you were splittin' up stacks
That shit you told the people got 'em under max
Now why, would you wan' do some shit like THAT?

I blow 50 G's, I mean with ease like this is nothing
Please don't interrupt me when I'm talking to my jeweler
He's putting them diamonds all over my Franck Muller
Me I get busy, I put that work in if it's worth it
Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggas talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped
See me in the club, I got that Henny and that 'gnac
A couple cups of that and I just don't know how to act
By the second bottle that's when I just get to buzzing
I said I run New York and ain't nobody saying nothing (okay, okay, okay)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
When they talk about me they say I be tripping (yeah)
What they say about me doesn't make me mad (nah, nah)
I think they hating cause they see me when I'm rolling (yeah)
Man, I can't help it that they really doing bad (nah, nah)
Okay, alright (they sick)
Okay, you're right (I'm rich)
Okay, alright (I grind)
Okay, you're right (for mine)

[Verse 2]
I blew a hundred G's on my bitches in Miami
They think I'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
Me I catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
I don't even know my name, switching lanes in my Bugatti
Nigga, I ain't crazy, bitches like me cause I'm paid
They want me, LeBron, Kobe or Dwyane Wade
When I say I'm balling I'm not talking 'bout a ball
I'm talkin' 'bout Tiffany & Co. stones out the mall
Niggas they can hate all they want, but they know they like this
Me I'm like that painting on the wall, baby I'm priceless
You could come and work me over, baby, on the night shift
Catch me on the night shift, see how freaky I get (okay, okay, okay)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
When they talk about me they say I be tripping (yeah)

Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines
Knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

If you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
They ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier
You now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
With all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94: ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes, motherfucker

A lil’ nigga hurt his arm, lettin’ off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol’ black nine
I’ll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol’ chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C’mon on man, you know how I shine
I’m in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns, a 100 clips, why I don’t hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought “Lean Back” was “In da Club”
My shit sold eleven mill’, his shit was a dud
Jada’ don’t fuck with me, if you wanna eat

Yeah homey in New York niggas like your vocals
But that’s only New York dawg, yo’ ass is local

Banks’ shit, sells; Buck’s shit, sells
Game’s shit, sells; I’m rich as hell
Shyne poppin’ off his mouth from a cell
He don’t want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I’m in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It’s an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you’s a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I’ll give you what I got

First flight, first seat and first class
First pair of Giuseppes, first Birkin bag
I’m Street King, so you’ll be fit for a king
When we step out on the scene it’s Alexander McQueen
It’s a ghetto fairy tale, I’ll be your night in shining armor
And retro Jordan’s, Giselle’s and a leather bomber
Bright lights, city life, I’ll show around New York a bit
From hot dogs and pretzels to the expensive shit
Cause we can shop till my nickname Saks Fifth
Madison Ave mindframe, baby I stack chips smile
Me cell phone’ll capture the moment
When your emotions start to shift
I’ma just shoot that over your brown eyes
To chocolate thighs
Make me wanna sing good lord

Can my vision and your ambition make the perfect recipe

In my mind ten times, I done took off your clothes
So if you’re thinking what I’m thinking, let me know it’s a go
I’m a gambling man, talking ’bout life not dicing
And that look in your eyes say it’s going down tonight

On the uptown block, he couldn't run from the cops
So my man got shot
In a jet black Brasada, across the street from his mom's crib on his block
I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't got a worry in the world, if it's beef, don't sing it, bring it
Parents warn their kids, about people like me
I'm out of order, I turn your only daughter, into a transporter
Before I die, I'm gonna see more blow than Rich Porter (woo)
50 Cent, don't get it fucked up from Queens, not Fort Greene
Let it go back to Smith, I dissect it
I check and correct it, flow perfected
I make shit hectic, I wreck shit, nigga check it
If you ain't tryin' to feel the flames from the blast
Respect a nigga cash
My smile will rock niggas to sleep, pack heat
Fuck the police, handle beef on the street
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 9 with 2 MM's
If your man want to get involved, I'll bring it to him
Niggas been wantin' me dead, I'm still here kid
They send their dogs to come get me
They wet shit, but they ain't hit me
Word in the hood is 50, shifty
Niggas they don't want to go against me
Cause they know I hunt your ass alive

[Hook]",50 Cent,Power of the Dollar,
"Chorus (4x):
Pray and pray
And pray for my downfall

Menace, scene from the movie
Clap the two, weigh the oozie
Goodfella jewelry heist
Diamonds in my bitch doobie
I sit back, think about the cats
They hate man I laugh at them
Get outta line I blast at them
They stay scheming
Fuck around let off a clip
And leave the whip leaning
They dreaming
I took the cream and
Move to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, shit
Cause when I flip
I make the paper
Dangerous, G-Unit
Niggas can't bang with us
It's undeniable the kid is nice
The flow CPR
I'll bring Biggie back to life
Man, Dre say I'm loony
Em say I'm moody
At least I don't smoke oolies
And fuck without rubbers
A handful of niggas hate
But the hood love us
You can pray
For my downfall
Motherfuckers

(Chorus 8x)

Even if I slip
I'll get back
Nigga act up
Hollowtips'll
Tear your back up
Gain 30 pounds
When you die, no lie
I was high when they hit me
Had a few gats with me, shit
Ain't get a chance to let off
They shot me up and sped off
Apologies in order
Tamia I adore her
But now they strict
Cause my flow make money
Flow like water
Turn it up a notch
Twist the dutch
Zone to this, soak it up
See me in the club son
I'll send niggas to poke you up
You know my style 40 cal
With me when I move around
Squeeze, catch the shell
And run before your ass
Hit the ground
Pussy niggas shouldn't talk
Keep my name out your mouth
Summerjam, understand
I'm the man
When I leave the crowd leave
Shook closer, game over
Ride or get rolled over

That's the sound of the man, cockin’ that thang - that thaaaang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang - thaaang
{verse1} Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin’, I got ya
Say a prayer for me if you care for me cuz I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it
Homie that took the hit on me couldn´t shoot
They say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin Uzi out in L.A. we trippin through the sets again



Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans
I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh you the black hand of death, then why your name ain't preacher
If you a pimp like kid, why the hoes don't treat ya
If you wanna ball like Kirk, now shorty let me teach ya
This flow’s God sent, it’s bound to reach ya

[Hook]
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems
I know how to solve em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve em
Shoot em up, rob em
In the hood we starvin, you don’t want problems
Problem child

[Bridge]
And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

{Verse2}
They say you can never repay the price for takin’ a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
+Blaaat+, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty
For evey bar in the rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
For every stone in the cross, there's a bitch I tossed



See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check C-N-N for the 'War Report'
See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help
Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young



Niggas jumped me cuz they couldn't beat me one-on-one

[Hook]

[Bridge]

{Verse 3}

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cuz pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass
I got 'God Understand Me' tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say: whats up, niggas get ready to duck'
My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don´t care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings
See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

Eenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'
Pick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I'll make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS
Come pick you up, you know you fucked when you get on the stretcher
'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home, get a nine, then commit crime to perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it

Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid
In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl, I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous

I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

'Cause I be paying child support now, goddamn it
Tish was my bitch, 'til she fucked my god brother
I was heated when I heard, wanted to go upside his head
It was Christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit
I ain't the sensitive type, I ain't sit' around crying

I gased memorized at her in with green eyes
I'm so into you baby we don't even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
'Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby spot in forty
Sold crack before rap so everybody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vick's spinning, Cheek's was the hottest rapper in the hood
I ain't hate, but on the low I didn't think he was good
We wore Timberland boots, Carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid, when his Filas shoes suede
Rock a Caesar or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a 62 like every couple days
I get knocked I come home it's all a part of the game
Catch a snitch, cut a snitch or put one in his frame
It's like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna Im copping out, so i don't need bail
Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail

And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself I'ma grind
As soon as I get out that paper what I'm about
After 4 months home I had the Land I shine
2 months later I copped the Benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it's hot, Task out
TNT on the block, make yourself get knocked

Niggas broke in my crib and they stole my Atari
Man, niggas could've asked, I would've let 'em hold a cartridge
I wasn't fucking with nobody, see how niggas start shit
Instead selling crack I could've been Tiger Woods
But they ain't got no fucking golf courses in the hood
I said I'm selling dope, I don't regret shit
I'm selling dope, nigga, that good shit
I was supposed to be an A student, a valedictorian
Instead I'm in special ED trying to fuck, I'm horny
They didn't like my style, they said they didn't like my style

In came the cash, out with the cocaine

Four finger ring, nigga doing his thing

Post up, coast up, this is my life, bitch
Up close on ya, you'll get stuck with a knife, bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got a lot of hoes, but Charlene that's my white bitch
The rest of my bitches, nah they ain't gon' like this
But I don't give a fuck cause they all love this nightstick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up, cool as the Fonz
Motherfucker! Have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
See it's a line there for a reason
And if you cross it, no more breathing, ya leaving
Believe it - we understand each other?
Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in ya, brother - ya dig?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, ho remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don

Four fifth on that shit, that Glock copped to ya face
My twat cocked in ya face, you know you wan' taste
Alexander McQueen, strapless with my back out
Six inch DaVinci's, a bitch finna act out
Niggas on my heels tryna find out what the head like
I know what the bread like, my butt give y'all headlight
Shine like I shine, night or daytime
But Nah, na na na na
Make a nigga wan' buy everything I say buy - ma na na na na
Get wet, I got that comeback, that crack
My assets is my ass, jack
Stun, I tell my niggas right where yo stash at
You fucking with a Southside bitch, I go where the money go

I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke, nigga
Same attitude, you got it, go 'head smoke, nigga
I'm fucking with a blonde bitch, I got my own fragrance
Powered by 50, goddamn it, I think I made it
I tried to keep it basic, they wanna complicate shit
The feds on my phone, that's why I don't ever say shit
Portray being a friend to me and I'll make you a memory
That .40 Cali barrel get to smoking like a chimney
Niggas sick of pussy shit and me I'm just the remedy
'03 get rich, nigga, you remember me?
Shorty rock her hips she get to looking like an entree
Bad bitch, fat ass, bouncing it like Beyoncé
She saying ""I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva""

What the fuck is the problem? Violence isn't the answer
I split your fucking head then get jammed up
Why did you call the cops? Why didn't you say I'm hot?
It's been six years I been here on top
You act like I'm a average nigga spitting a average flow
Fucking with average bitches like everywhere that I go
I'm not focused on hoes, I'm focusing on the dough
And I won't talk to you after my next album blow

Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slipping, then get hit with like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feeling
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villain
I play the bar with eight bottles all night getting right
Teaching the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on my wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga scheming, what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hoes confused
On the track ready to choose, like ""Daddy, we want you""
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York

Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should hear they be saying man ""50 be flipping""
""Shot my man over seven grams, that nigga be tripping""
I know death is promised, I don't fear getting murked
It's when a nigga half-way kill ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with the pump
You can have it how you want, but I know you like my style
Uh-huh, you like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
Take this pack, pump these pieces, that's how we get down

Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell
The East coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feelin' like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic, shit

This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homie this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen, your fuckin' brain's on drugs
Look ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on a TEC
Fool trippin' threw a set, you can get yo ass wet
Cards messin' up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid yo ass better come correct

So its a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed to
Heavy pistol shells'll lift you
My gun tear through lungs and rip through tissue
While I'm out for amends, you out for a rep
That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black Lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the car lot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches
So I'm gon sell like the box office features

But deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!

And plus we on the road to the riches

Hope they ain't tap the phones

Therefore I'm on the move with the squad
I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the car
And a pool in the yard
You don't really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing? You gotta be strapped to get rid of me
I'll leave you in water like the Statue of Liberty
I'm tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for Benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

Gimme his watch and his chain

I go to war to my heart stop, niggas ain't listening
Get the thumping and the dumping at your newborn's christening
Tell your homie, tell his homies, he 'gon need more homies
Ain't this a bitch I got the extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
The Ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give your ass a permanent nap-- sing you a lullabye
I got money to run, so fuck an alibi

[Chorus]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning or the night, I spot-cha I gotcha
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops asking 'who shot-cha'
As the world turns, [?] will be learned
The hollow tips burnin and I ain't concerned if I ain't hit
Than I ain't hit, so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you fucking with
Come through dump more than a clip
Niggas be on some stupid shit
Till they get hit, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
K-I double, shot gun barrel double
I always run a couple and I move 'em on a double
Racks in the duffel, Mac with the muzzle
Makin' circles in you, all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay outta trouble
I got a big gun, mutha-fuckers scuffle
Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?
FUCK NO! Pimp zone, Rida gang, you already fuckin' know

Man these niggas so fake, I call 'em knock off
Like Pringles I pop the top off
You ain't hot dog, you the fucking Micky Mouse (aw)
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck fifty niggu
You scuff these I’ll scar your face, buck fifty, nigga
Been fucking with them pigs, you a guinea niggu
And you always begging, you's a ''give me'' nigga
I wear my gun like its trendy niggu
You pussies ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitching getcha
Right in front of this pistol

Cause the first chance she get I'm in her mouth on the tour (WHAT?)
I'm lovin the ladies, with no husbands or babies
Since little I've been active, lost dozens of babies (C'MON!)
Gettin a hummer stuntin, in your cousin Mercedes
Or roll up on you dumpin, pourin guns at your 80's (WHAT~?!)

That's probably why they wanna see me in chalk in the ground
But you can find me on the corner with a pack of marijuana

You wanna spray at me? Go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dread serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch please
This is stash house, jackpot, there go them keys
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek with marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career

I'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at AI peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low key

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the Glock and run up in your spot
Six double O drop I'll put two in your knot
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got

The block's hot warrant squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, move on po po, blast the fo fo
Roll dolo rock solo, I should be OT on the low yo
Park the 6 and push the Volvo
I hear they go cuckoo when they puff Co Co
I sell Yayo the price up and down like yo-yo

I make 16 hundred off of every O yo

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for rec
While you niggas race neck to neck
While niggas who live from check to check
I ain't even going to front I ain't working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat
As soon as I start dreaming I'm right back on the street
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me
Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee

I told Jimmy Iovine ass to shut the fuck up
Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?
We done came this far, we can't stop now
Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down
I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul
Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick
You know Em made that company over a billion dollars
And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him
Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops
We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop
You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise

You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod
She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard
She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash
But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass
Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my Glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school

I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand

She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin' the word is

She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: a house is not a home without her
I had 'em panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wantin' is temporary 'cause for sure she gon' get it, wassup

Better yet, to watch you climb into the Jacuzzi

It's fun, but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots, I like Jeeps and Coupes
So I grind all the time to save me some loot
I put a spell on ya, I like to call it a spell

Everybody mad, damn, even my dad
And I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?
I ain't giving nobody shit, I'ma show them
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick
Start screaming ""Westside"" and Dre ain't say shit

I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back",50 Cent,Soldier,"Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo"

Well, I’ll stomp ya fucking head til it’s under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
Before I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas ain't made of the same shit I’m made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
Then he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Kids laughing like hyenas in a crib full of roaches
Call grandmami ""mommy"" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missing since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playing games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me I’mma off ‘em

Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh it’s an emergency
Your love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See, I have an advantage I don’t care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin’ when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds, now a nigga half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened, we’re all gonna die
You can say a prayer when I’m coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater

Man anything goes when it comes to hoes
Ma your feet look good, let me suck on them toes
And if your body smell right, let me lick all them holes
I bust a nut in your face and wipe my dick on your clothes
Baby - spark the blunt and light the incense
Now it's time to freak off with my project princess
Y'all groupies wanna talk, and send fanmail
Cause y'all see me in The Source and the XXL (ha ha ha~!)

[50 Cent - singing]
Everybody wants to be real
Still they wanna hide how they feel
Nigga you're supposed to be real
When niggas find out that you're tellin
Nigga you gonna get yo' cap peeled
Cause they get it, and now you know you gon' it
Truuuuuuuuuuuue, I know true thugs are hard to find

I hear niggas running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 1]
I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimey nigga
Think he shot my brother I'm a find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that chalk gray Land
That nigga robbin' and stealin' everything that he can

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know Curtis, he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in his Benz
Niggas from my buildin' always used to ask about him
Like he in and out of town, right? That niggas get down, right?
I used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money
And you standin' in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 3]
I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he roll with Dr. Dre and Shady

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggas running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 4]
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
I can't believe this nigga gettin' all this money
Still actin' like he in the street tellin' niggas they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggas out
That's that bullshit. See what I'm talkin' about?

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 5]
That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin' sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock or pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I taught him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are

[Hook]
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze, hit him through the do'
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
These niggas is green

[Verse 1]
It's nothing to it, cock it, bang it and get rid of that
Hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to Twitter that
I make the Ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
You better have God with you when I come to you
I'm a grimy nigga, I said some simple shit
You's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
I catch you I'mma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
Leave you right there in the street where niggas can find you
Die, nigga, die, fly, pelican, fly
When I pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
That's the laws of the jungle, I'll show you what the gun do
My bad, what the shell do, you rot until they smell you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get green, son, get him, cut his head
He didn't even see it coming, he sleeping, that's what he did
Get biz, niggas acting like it ain't what it is
Let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
Let Doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
In my hood growing up you pussy or you 'bout it
You shooting or you running, the police coming
Niggas get at you you get at them or you don't mean nothing
Niggas walk tough, even walk like warriors
On some G shit, they get to singing like Gloria
Now come clean, tell us what you told the D's
Matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker, hold these

[Interlude]
Yeah, feels like summer to me
Expect it nice and hot
40 day, my bad, my bad

[Verse 1]
How you gonna take this? like a man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 summers in the jail I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leak in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
Big as hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
Damm dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convo is only three words, ""yo what up""
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After witnesses disappear on the strength of they team
I'm hard as hell to get along wit' so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper - blowin' the lah
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now?
If I catch you going to sick call I'm'a ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gemstar is like a nine milli chrome
It's similar, in fact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home

[Hook]
You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
Rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
You only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas juxed you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
You ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)

[Verse 2]
You'd call me Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like ""Fifty don't play son""
""yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga...""
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock
Bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window....out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
Since '86 my whole clique pop Criss

See every now and then I smile just not today

Somebody probably got shot today
I named em pop when niggas surfboard
You ain't stoppin me dawg
Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
You will, die by the gun if you ain't droppin ya sword
I got tattoos as well as lead marks
To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
Beef, you a target
Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin won't be the only one the carpet
Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I ain't a peoples person
I'll give my next door neighbor the finger (fuck you)
Even though I got the shit in the stores
I'm like a nigga that borrow clothes
Bitch, I'm tryin to get in ya draws

Pussys love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear bandaids
I'm blowin on damn haze
All of a sudden I'm gassed, cause I'm on the radio and I can't wave
If you ain't up on thangs
Lloyd Banks is the name, G-Units the game
Now I know to keep low when the heat blow

Still get the green from P-dro, better known as Pedro

Nigaas talkin in the pens and in the street about me
Some jake, tryin to watch every move I make
Cause my diesel will make fiends do the up-town shake
I'm a pro, far from a amateur, holdin more keys than your fuckin janitor
They say ""God bless the child that could hold his own""
You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You ain't gotta like or love me but you gone respect me
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me
12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin
Look homie I'm down for that day-time action
Keep thinkin it's a game time in front of ya home

My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on
Don't get moved on
Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts
Then breeze through ya projects
When the coke come back
It's the China White
And the d don't sweat us in a bag a rice
Let's ride O T
And burn the tape
I got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank
Since Yayo be a fearless man
I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
And, those niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas
Prepare for class

Boy you forgot my style

[Verse 1]
Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think ''nigga better you than me''
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing

I want the beat to drop in, right, like, now
Niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right? Yeah, you are crazy
I ain't crazy - you are crazy - at least I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot  you hot, but you crazy
Why they wanna? I don't know

[Verse 1]
It's the money that makes shit get ugly
It's the money that makes these hoes love me
It's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me
Man, I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do and see
The felonies from day to day make me say what I say
When I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's
Don't cry for me, smile for me
And if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read ""I Tried"" and from the start
Everything I wrote was from my heart
So it’s always gon' be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
Sometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin'
This shit is real, it ain't a game

First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid
So I get vest up when I get dressed up
In the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up
If it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup
If you gossiping about me shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
When getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is give me the cash
Forget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass
Be a good boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
Alright, run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash

They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

[Verse 3]
I know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast
Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
Man listen, if you really really like this shit
Nigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
Call him now before I drop for real cause after I drop
I'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop
To each his own: me? I'd get it while it was cheap
Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat
Niggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat
Give me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat
You're a generous guy, take 'em off or die
Man, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies
Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
Why you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh? You high?
See, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye

I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong

I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunchtime I start hitting 'em hard with punchlines
You cats got to be sick to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro
Plus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me running from Jake in a GS with bad brakes

Yo, son remember them fake players who try to play us
At *The Shark Club* in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators
Looking like last year's players
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bottle of Mo
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding
(Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son)
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since '81
They ain't here on a hunt for food
So they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move

[Verse 1]
I had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
Fo'-hundred Benz, eight thousand in cash
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, Banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt yo' ass
Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
Then told myself in the mirror ""nigga, you ain't dead""
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it
When you see me in the hood motherfucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about using the hawk for me
When Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go fronting again, I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace
I serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast

[Hook]
You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit time the police come
Huh? You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
Huh? You want some?

[Verse 2]
I got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple
Shooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you
Got more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want, boy
You wanna be nice to me, you wanna shoot dice with me
You want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?
Nigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
You got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch
Getting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary
And I'm saying that house should be a crack house
Now see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out
The tech and the mac out, the Sig and the Taurus
The Koch and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin'
I let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign
Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded
Toss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it
'Til it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?

Niggas trying to front? We move on them
One up 'side the waist, squeeze the Ruge on them
Next day we outside like who want it?
Niggas think something is sweet until we move on them

Go through that block they pump, wave that Uzi at them
Next day we in the hoopties looking for them

I'm the Mechanic
I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit
I come through to spit clips
(Called the mechanic
Niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
With a hard head; a nigga head open, he soft
I provide these services, we breaking them off
I'm a familiar face from the land of the lost
I used to be a worker bee, now a nigga a boss
It's like every now and then I'm back to being a Mechanic
I split a nigga head, I'm a grease monkey with it
My Momma told me ""Baby Boy, the Lord going to bless us""
The dope bought us shit the food stamps couldn't get us
Man, they don't understand, we were just trying to make it
But where I'm from if you want shit, you got to take it
I'm a Trojan of War, I get it done like Achilles
My Tre pound will cut a nigga down on the str-id-eets (streets)
I never had drama with Spics, Jews, or Guineas
But once over a bitch a nigga tried to kill me
I was coming out his projects, I let off the semi
You asking about Nedgme, they know me

Here, the hammer right here. Now move on them

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Niggas is loose, I grab the cig and tighten niggas up
I lost my path in the dark, I'm lighting niggas up
I'm the school yard with your kid playing dodge ball
Then out come the hammer, can shorty dodge those?
I got a few screws missing, maybe even a bolt
A few shooters with me, down to go for the fall
I say ""Get'em!"" they get to killing like I'm running the court
Then get down with these around. The hulks in your throat
This is not amateur night and this ain't the Apollo
Ain't nothing saying the sun is coming out tomorrow
Your arm is broke and the promise of Death is coming
So if you want for me that homicide, I'm gunning

Money buys guns, paranoia comes
When the drama comes, go ahead pussy run
Friends turned foes, Daddy girl's turn hoes
In the penitentiary hearts turn cold
Some turn snitch for State's evidence
While the big boys with the blow keep getting rich
When the drama comes they way they don't fucking panic
They hop on the phone quick to holler at mechanics

This is how monsters function
Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse 1]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo-Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me, baby, take me
Since high school, nigga, I ain't got no friends
Got two 380s like the Ying Yang Twins (Haaan)
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill herringbone, I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Ruger, that Pump and that Tec at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body
Then I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit, you got to love it
Trey-eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping, niggas hold down the tools

[Hook]
I seen niggas getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse 2]
Unsure since we was little niggas, son, since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky motherfucker, I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man?
How much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse
She thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money, son
Cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

The Lord don't have imperfections, baby

Yo daddy, these nigga's ain't hood, drop that shit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
So what I grew up with them niggas, i ain't stuck with them niggas
We from the same hood but I don't fuck with them niggas
Shit pop off, I touch one of them niggas
Cut one of them niggas, buck one of them niggas
Beg For Mercy, number four, I'm so hood
First LP, ten-million sold, I'm so good
I thought niggas would love to see me shine
But it's making them sick to see me getting mine
Got that Benz, got that Bentley, and that new Bugatti
Got that Range, Aston Martin, and that new Ferrari
If it's making you sick to see me blow I'm sorry
Dude we used to be cool, but I ain't stuck with you nigga
I grew up with you nigga, but I don't fuck with you nigga
Got shot in the back then turned around and got shot in the eye
You ain't gonna shoot back lay down and die
There's a message in my music, can you hear it Kai?
Your man's never gonna blow and you're the reason why
It's disease infested when I spit it any nigga can get it
Fuck the fronting and the rhymes that ass'll get flat-lined
Can't we all just get along? we used to be friends
Nah, fuck that, man we used to pretend
These niggas is comedians, I thought I was type funny
Five called telling niggas, ""mutt need bail money""
On some real shit, would you bail a nigga out son, that knew niggas was trying to kill you and wouldn't let you hold a gun
Think about it
Hahaha

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Regardless of what you done heard or hearing
Fuck all the comparing I dare them to come anywhere near him
They want someone famous to pout with so I walk around with my gun like it came with the outfit
I don't really like to toot my own horn but beep, click clack, blat, go to sleep
We all know since you was in the class with Legos, you'd grow up to be as soft as mash potatoes
Your man gonna make me throw this nigga towards the window and put his ass in the air like the Jordan symbol
All my diamonds are colored, I Fruity Pebble'd the right hand, fifty-five grand on the bezel from Ice Man
They want to give your boy the 40 cal and nina so I stay on my toes like a ballerina
I'm starving nigga, the only one that can cut me and get away with it is my barber, nigga
Cause I'll revolve a nigga, take a piece of your head
You'll have more room in your hat than a Harlem nigga
And now most of these subliminal raps be coming from the same niggas backstage giving you daps
Like, ""yo banks you hot and everybody says it and I think it'd be real big if we could do a record""
But now I'm on some other shit
Like I ain't fucking with none of you niggas on a record unless you my brother shit
I'm an intelligent man and my elegant band got more colors than elephant man
Since hell is at-hand I mine as well expand hand over my can
Tan all over the lamb, lamb all over the sand
The sun all over the beach, your eyes all over my bitch
Her eyes all on your moves incase one of them switch
If you don't learn to relax and swallow steam, there'll be more shells in the grass than halloween",50 Cent,These Niggas Aint Hood,Lloyd Banks

Governor, G-G-G-G-G-Unit~!

She ain't that chick from the burbs that's a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock persona
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo' sho' we belong together
And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions are better
And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the D's came she was down to hold the baretta
I got a thing for babygirls, me and her against the world

[Governor - singing]
We used to think the same schemes, with the same dreams in mind
10'll bring you back 20 if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker, with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore, to win she'd give her life
Or shoot to kill, to protect this life

[Hook: Governor]
The world will hear, what's really goin on, in my life - my life
The world will see, what was really down down, in my life - my life
If you only knew, the pain I feel; if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww, what's goin onnnnnnn, yeah~!

[50 Cent]
You're sunshine, your smile make my day
It's simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips, your thighs, got me hypnotized
Communication's deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma
Materialistic; still a nigga want her
Consistantly missin her touch when she gone, uhh
She smell like Chanel, she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I've been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider, I'm in heaven when I'm inside her
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck, ""12 Play"" in the deck
Fo'play correct, have her drippin wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nuttin of it

Back writing like I need me a deal, I'll show you the steel
It's a jux, nigga, feel the chill
Up your spine, I'm a menace for real, I blast to kill
Leave your brains on the dash and wheel

Them niggas in the way of the money, let's shoot ahead
The rest of them suckers'll scattered, they don't matter

And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Hook]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike

While you be all in her DM, nigga
I be all in that BM with her
You be all in your feelings 'bout it
Like ""when I see him I'mma kill this nigga""

I fuck a bad bitch 'till she ugly
Put the pussy in recovery
I’m like, ""now what you think of me?""
Niggas goin’ out just to talk to these hoes
Blowin’ big bankrolls on clothes
Now they wonder where the money at
Yeah, the motherfucking money that they had from the re-up gone
I don't do no stalkin'

I don't do much talkin'

You act like you can't get enough
That bitch there like dopeboys
If you got money she goin' for it
I drink that hoe, her head so good
She gon' have you there like, ""oh lawd""
All this time you ain't on
I done bought her shit you can't afford

It's a wrap and I'm ghost in the smoke like a roach
You've been clapped and in fact there's no coming back from that
I'm the last of my breed, no Henny, no weed
Just my vest and my semi in the back of the Bentley
Enage, a mirage, see I'm there, then I'm gone
Cause my lawyers are strong and my money is long

There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love
Except loyalty and love between thugs
For you I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip
For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this the way I show my love for you
Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
Cause with a record like yours, doawg, you ain't staying upstate
Nigga for you, I kill a whole goddamn crew (Why?)
Cause I know you'd do the same thing too
I ride for you, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a thug like me?

[Chorus: 50 Cent + Lloyd Banks]
Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask
Would you die for me?
Nigga, they blast you, they blast me
Would you cry for me?
Shit, when I die don't cry for me
Just keep repping Southside for me
Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask

You can catch me in public housing with bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains bundled up to ski
Since time is money I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You see the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice I'm seeing shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind I wear the same shit tomorrow
When you grind it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hot sixteen
Well, my flow's like a hoe that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun, bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the hood, my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still living like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice I'm called Jack Frost, man
And while we sipping on Cris' you sipping backwash, man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat - what?",50 Cent,True Loyalty,"Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks"

You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one

[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it’s special y'all
A country boy tell 'ya ""I’m a finna to blow""
I’m more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I’m in this for the paper, but I don’t love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know 'em little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won’t you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching, you watching me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Ha ha

[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me",50 Cent,U Not Like Me,

If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
Ah man
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl

[Verse 1]
I'm waitin' on you to come, baby I'm that man
Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman
I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth, CPR
Bring ya back to life, climax, start your after life
Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
Have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic
She givin' me something I can feel like En Vogue
Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back on
Back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her Craftmatic
Jack rabbit, addiction, I don't wanna break that habit
Your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me
City life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me
I wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk
Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park
Bullseye right through her head, to her heart
It's mental and physical, when you're gone, I'll be missin' you

[Hook]
You gon' get it, you gon' get it
I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl)
Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha)
I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?)
When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)

[Verse 2]
I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack
2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that
The touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason
I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin'
Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor, I make her smile while passin' time
It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play, until I touch her 'til she cream
Cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel, she in between
Got that island girl swag, she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
See how I switch gears, her bra gone it's on
It's showtime, it's my turn to perform
Leave the lights on, while I get it, I got it good
She sayin' she love my show, I'm sayin' I knew she would

It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'

You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'

[Bridge]
Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

[Verse 3]
'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?
We ridin' round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

And start lettin' off until niggas is no longer problems
I watch the blood seep in the street, I'm swift wit the heat
I hit a nigga quick, Know why? niggas hit me
They call me 50 my aka is two gun Charlie
Find me up at 4 in the mornin' to catch me a body
Waitin' for you in yo projects by your staircase door
Come out! Come out! pussy you can't hide from a war
I get impatient then I'm bringin' it to yo people, I ring the doorbell then I'm puttin' one through your peephole
Boy it's a no,no to fuck wit me cause i'm not your equal

I got bricks of that raw sittin' in that rice man
And a long fo'fo when I'm at da dice game
You won't catch me slippin' when I'm hittin' them licks

So I'm makin moves fast like my name was D. Wade

The platinum, the chains, and the diamond rings

I see you when you crouch by ya window pane
Now shorty, me and you we came up the same
The fact before rap, I ain't have a thing
I hustled, got my weight up, now I'm sittin on change
I mean I got money out the ass, maine
When niggas get the beefin', I be laughin'
Cause I can send my homies through to blast them
Stick 'em with the hump, or just slash 'em
""Now fool are you crazy?"" Is what we ask 'em
But back to me and you shorty, decide, think

I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I’m used to the bullshit, it don’t matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self

You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I’m havin’ the epiphany you niggas ain’t shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I’m from

Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas

Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular

Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin' what if?
Homie I play the block tryin' to get my packs off - sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?

[Verse 1]
If I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy
Niggas in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
Niggas would think I bump my fuckin' head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady
If I put out bullshit joints like AZ
Every chance niggas get, they'd try and play me
But I move around with a little .380
A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
Niggas'll say ""50 that ain't gangsta, fuck ya""
Man I'ma just keep doin' what I do
Cause niggas can't do me, better than I do, ha ha

Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin' what if?
Homie I play the block tryin' to get my packs off - sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?

[Verse 2]
What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?
And all the backpack niggas loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin' so cool
What if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homie 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
Shit I'd give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap nigga you didn't know
You'd be sayin' ""Damn that kid got a sick flow""
What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin' Curtis Mayfield or Marvin, somethin' smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha ha

Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?

Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'mma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?
She just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say, ""Hell naw!""

And do it like we're supposed to
Cause we're gonna win

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history
I'm trying to make it feel like the first time
Like a junkie I'm sort of chasing my first high
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm ready
Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
There's only one number 1, nigga, I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it
Condos, condoms and bad bitches to be with
Run with a winner, baby
Be unconventional, freak me off with friends maybe
You can be my girl, be my fair weather friend
Or you could be my, yeah yeah, be my friend 'til the end

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
Cause we're gonna win

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I got that disease ambition, success is the cure
They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure
I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains
The heart of a nigga homicidal on the chain gang
I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch
I wanna see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm limitless, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got is highly contagious
We hustled 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when niggas been bidding for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
A nigga risk it all for the broads
(What's up?)

[Hook: Guordan Banks]

"[Verse 1]
Look If you ain't worth a mil, you ain't far from broke
Got enough heart to sell weed but you scared of dope
I wouldn't snitch on my peoples if the feds bribed me
Yo ass would hit more notes than Ron Isley
I wouldn't rhyme about Rolleys if I had no watch
Wouldn't write about crack if I ain't had no spot
You talk six coupe's, shit you only pushing a trey
Got bitches shutting you down in the C.L.K
For cats like you, crime don't pay
You just linger in the hood, then niggas blow you away
You the type to get paper when I'm locked up, get yo jewels rocked up
Then have to tuck em in when I pop up
Niggas in the hood sayin ""50's Grimy""
Cause they hit me with consignment and now they can't find me
If you see it how I see it, my watch is yo whip
And I can cop another one after each assist

[Hook]
You ain't no gangsta
You'se a busta, a customer, a sucker
You fake fraudulent motherfucker
You ain't a gangsta
I should cut ya, cock back and bust ya or stomp you out
Cause we don't trust ya

[Verse 2]
You owe a nigga? You don't wanna pay him?
Kill him, that's what they said Ta Ta did to Peewee
Y'all ain't got to believe me
When I'm done with this rhyme if theres time I'll hit a flick
Wit Mariella, this connect bitch, Peruvian chick
She ain't hot but everytime I fuck, the coke price drops
When it's time to get it on (what)
I pull over the thong (uh huh)
Fuck till I nut then get up, I'm gone (yeah)
Usualy hit it watchin tele way out in L.A
I like it when she say ""Papi I feel it in my Belly""
Call up all my niggas in New York on the celly
First thing I'm sayin is ""Nigga what da deally""
Pack a trey pound up under my Pelle Pelle
Y'all niggas want war, clap clap, Oh really?
I watch niggas sling packs in front of the Deli
Got 20 inch chrome sittin on my Pirelli's
Lorenzo on the Benzo, nigga you feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fix the cell, blast the room devil spray, turnin proof
Ho whip, bulet proof, you ain't fuckin wit me, duke
Bricks from Filipe, 19 five, what we pay
Cop on a weekend, hard to catch em on a weekday
Niggas backed up, slugs to the gut, that'll bet him up
Gettin fed thru his arm in a hospital will slim him up
Get it thru yo head, 50 Cent don't care
I cock triggers light the blockup, iller than times square
Real shit, you spit it cause you seen it
I spit it cause I did it and I mean it
Man, I don't like none of y'all
Fuck around I'll run in y'all pop one in y'all
Had the whole hood talkin bout what I done to y'all
Listen I don't give a fuck if you blood or cuz
I got love for thugs niggas firing slugs
Stage rapping ass niggas ain't sold no drugs
Gotta show me some love cause my shit is unplugged

[Hook]",50 Cent,You Ain’t No Gangsta,
"[Verse 1]
I’ll put this shit together, I’ll tear this shit apart
Demolition, the architect, I’ll let you see the spark
Bullet open your head make your brain a landmark
Put what you thinking on the curb nigga mark my word
If there’s a L to take it’s gon' be your loss
Double-barrel buck spray, your ass get tore off
You’ve been warned, you hard nigga I’m just gon' hit you harder
Guard ya, stick ya, rip ya
Extended clip ya
Graze ya, blaze ya, hard to miss with the laser
You talk shit I (hawk spit) spit the razor
The mastermind, the muscle
Boy I know how to touch you
I plot it, plan it, then execute it dammit

[Chorus]
You a killer, you that nigga, you put work in all the time
You a shooter it’s nothing to you, you maneuver with the 9
I heard it all before, I’m strapped coming at you boy
This what, beef or war? I get the drop, blow your face on the floor
I don’t believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop up on ya

[Verse 2]
Nigga make one false move around me I say “fuck it I’m ridin'”
And ain’t no sense in tryna duck me motherfucker I’ll find ya
I'm still goin' through my 50-niggas-everywhere-I-go phase
Catch me slippin' no days
You pussy niggas no way
To stop me you gon' need at least a Mack boy
Shoot me with a .25 I be like “what you do that for?”
That party popper ain’t gon' cut it
But once you crossed the line you crossed the line nigga so fuck it
I’m built for it
Try to do the shit I do get killed for it
Pints of blood spill for it
Beef I’m still for it
Niggas wanna bump with Ferrari, prolly they ain’t get the memo
I got cake, it’s your wake
My gun or money make a nigga put a mask on
Shoot a head or break a leg, put a cast on

[Chorus]
You a killer, you that nigga, you put work in all the time
You a shooter it’s nothing to you, you maneuver with the 9
I heard it all before, I’m strapped coming at you boy
This what, beef or war? I get the drop, blow your face on the floor
I don’t believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop up on ya",50 Cent,You A Killer..Cool,
"[Intro]
Cee-lo, we know
I'm sitting on leather, I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
Cause I snap right back to the beginning, nigga

[Hook]
You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot

[Verse 1]
I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy, if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Wanna party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread
I'm big money, big business, I love it
Put the bad bitches with big asses and the budget
I'm the boss, so you know shit is going how it gotta go
I don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spend no expense
First I'm happy then she happy that she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a buck
Flip and catch an attitude like ''Bitch, what the fuck?""
You want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?'
Look, girl, you know you're sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the set you claim, motherfuck the gang you bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums
That party get the popping then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999
Flat top Gazelle, the swag going back in time
I got it locked, they can't ignore it
Man, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it
Heroin Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking ''Damn, why me?''
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live
I let it off, inside and outside
The club rocking, it's on tonight
Them bottles popping, we getting right

You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Momma baby boy is a killa
Ain't it funny how them guns get to pop for the scrilla?
Four bodies at 19, man I love that little nigga
For 5 grand niggas'll air the strip out
For 10 grand niggas'll run up in your house
Have you ass tryna talk with a gun up in ya mouth
New York has taught niggas to get money Down South
But get knocked in the commonwealth, stake your ass out
Fuck the captain, fuck the sarge
Fuck the king's that's in charge, bitch

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's

When my warriors come out and play, I'm Osirus
I eat, sleep, shit and catch niggaritis
And beat niggas down like the turtles on Riker's
I'm a cheap ass connect with some high ass prices
I've been totin'.fo-fo's and Mack-10's
Since Tim Dog was on raw, G ten
I'm the nigga on the strip that make feinds relapse
I'm the nigga on the strip that's a walking G pack

You said you're ready, you're not ready

In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I don't bash woman, but I'll throw a bitch in a sleeper
I been this way since Rakim was kicking a speaker
You can fly on holiday's like Christmas and Easter
The only way yellow ice is if you piss in the freezer
I'll put your partner in a case and park him off of pace
You suppose to be getting money, cheddar carpet off your face
I'm in the blaze, top runner in the race
Nike fanatic, spent spring summer [?]
Look what happened to Ma$e, I hope you see them same lighters
And my tape pound from me, put you on tubes and vitamins
I might've been slunked in the G-5 drunk and
Thumpin' the chronic one ridin' with the Thump Jiva
I'm on the run from marriage to rolling the carriage
To go with the average, give me someone established
I'm performing if they come with the carros
These bitches want my son in their carriage
But I don't wanna feel dumb and embrassed, bitch

Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
'Cause I don't like y'all anyway
Man, I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, BOW! What up, homie?
Them bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me

[Verse 1]
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The Ds run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracs
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah!)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, and sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words, I make a blind man see (Woo!)

I'm not a marksman while sparking, so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear ""he say, she say"" shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blat!)
Do it Cali style, drive by and tear ya block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, ""Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You're just a small player in this game, play your part, son

These cats always escape reality when they rhyme (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes (Yeah!)
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR, truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash, paw
See 'em in the five with stock rims, I just laugh, pa (Hahaha)
I catch stunts when I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I sip Dom P til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo!)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme
You better watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MCs that can kill you in eight bars
50, um... Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends

Now killing won't be hard for me
Cause I can't feel a thing

Sunday morning, preacher in the pulpit
Kissed my nanna, I can't listen to this bullshit
It's all good til they ask me for an offering
All we got is pain, so that's all I can offer him
My mama cold, she put me in this cold world
Left me, what I got to protect me?
Oh, I got a 9, yeah I got a 9!
And all this ambition, bitch I'm on the grind
Sky's the limit, 2 for 5's the gimmick
You line something up, I tie something up
They run up out that crib with that money, nigga what
School of hard knocks, I'm ahead of my class
With no hesitation put a hole in your ass
See, no it's never my fault when I fuck up
I knock your ass out, to wake you the fuck up
Brass knuckles and my knife: now tell me wassup

I made it to a half a mansion, shit I thought I made it
Hood bitches on a nigga, yeah all on a nigga
The D's his the door with the batter ram
I'm standing by the toilet that's broke, tryna flush this shit
Bizzy was my nigga started fucking with that cracker shit
Beat me out my money, nigga ran off with my mac kid
I was down, he kicked me when I'm down
When I think about this kid, it fucks my head up right now
You know the same niggas that got me shot, killed your brother
And you ain't never did shit about that, motherfucker
When niggas was beefing with you, I shot that park up
Now I'm thinking about the occasions, my gun blazing
You got me feeling like a sucker B

You took my heart from me
(Son, I don't give a fuck son we can back right now)
I'll never be the same
(Niggas gonna try and front on me and be right there?)
Now killing won't be hard for me

Cause I can't feel a thing

I'mma go and I'mma go back, fuck that
I'mma stay on them niggas 'til they can feel me breathing on them
You, you look at these fake ass niggas
They think cause they saying some fake shit in music, that the shit I be saying ain't real
All you gotta do is ask niggas, they tell you about me
They dont say Fifty though they say Boo Boo
Uh uh

Find out if I let it go
