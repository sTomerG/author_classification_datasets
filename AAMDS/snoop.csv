"[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

[Snoop Dogg]
The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, ""Break off some cheese""
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
On ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)
It's like that!

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside
Eastside, yeah nigga we ride

All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...

[Verse 1]
Instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cos I'm gon' make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
Let me tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh 'til i expire from existence
With persistence, I proceed
Supplying you with what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
The best pick out the litter, LB young nigga
I'll eat your soul out my dog bowl, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin' doo-doo
I'm steppin' on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin' full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got 'em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want 'em close enough so I can lock on 'em
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on 'em
Check this out here man, I lick 'em, sick 'em
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what, what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin' licks like the Doberman Gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

[Verse 3]
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Weed out, DP'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone

"[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my Glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm trying to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up 'til they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to my name

[Chorus: Fiend]
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed

[Verse 2: Fiend]
I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it, unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended Glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for [?] this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My [?] can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental Cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin' 'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
Shot

[Chorus: Fiend]
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed

[Verse 4: Silkk the Shocker]
Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels good to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit Some out the projects dumb shit
Some weed and blunt shit Some I don't give a fuck shit
Where it from shit Some penitentiary solitary
Confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick
Door Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
Y'all call me down [?] do get scared I ain't flipped 'til my guns smoking
It be a hustle just to eat And it be hard on these streets
Gotta get my hustle

I know you niggas don't see me as much as you'd like
'Cause I'm out gettin' money when I'm rockin' the mic
I'm a long way from Locus Ave, my locas have
Been there with me through the good and bad
Know look, let me reminisce, and twist a fuckin' blunt to spark
I got put on, '84 at King Park
Shottin' hoops with Charlie Mo and [?]
With the bumblebees, real east-side G's
Then go to [?] and ball out for any black ass
And wait for all the bitches at Poly to get outta class
I'm poppin' at 'em from a distant, but I'm persistent

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like ""What you mean Dogg?""
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
To a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded

Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green

Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please

Enough to wake neighbors up

Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit

When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to ""One Love""
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, ""Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?""
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went ""Ahhh""
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids

Catch me lookin' flossy, I done hooked up wit the boss and
Where he got his share of thrust is not my fault
I'm handsome enough without the clothes and the [?]
But I'm rough, bossin' up on all them hoes, think I'm a star
I hustle and I call it like I see it, can't sleep
I need some money, stressed out, I'm about to fight
Bite off that weed or somethin'
To make it happen is the mission that they send me to get wit
Not all fall out dawg house, I represent this

They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
5-7 clean, that's that big boy whip
State Seattles mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I mack at a bitch, that's the big boy spit
King of the coach, yeah, I earned my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah, I earned that shoe
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings
So how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows in arenas, bitches picker than Trina
Party like rock stars at the bars where I seen her
Made my move closely, you owe me
I had you in the club for 10 years sipping slowly
To my shit classics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?

[Verse 2]
Slow motion in the fast lane
Feeling so alone blowing domes in the crap game
Sitting at the top of the game where you ain't
Got every type of car so now I just play the paint
Show after show, bank row in the Rolls
Living nice, big slice, got me slamming cans a doors
Three piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop comin on[?], you all riding chrome like you gotta stop soon
Did it the G way, he say, she say
Peer pressure to me, way to stop, bang in the seat way
I was the hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed and people said I rapped like I was chilling
Way above the stars, Snoop Dogg is top feeling
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3]
Who get it like I done it? (Nobody)
You just in it, nigga, I run it
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Like I can't get in your grill 'cause I live in the hills
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed
Young ass buster, let me see your ID
I just chunked up a bill passing VIP
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me
Been crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do
See me walking and that whole world doing it too
They play follow the leader, boss on the move
Shot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes

You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

Grass and trees, ass up, bitch, on your knees

Or try to squab with us
No weapon formed against me shall prosper

About somebody who can save anybody

Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', Crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

How can I love somebody else

Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are

Player play it, coz you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit

You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue and
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

Is it because I'm black?
Somebody tell me, what can I do?
(Cause their ain't enough bars
To hold the the drama that we've been through)

[Verse 1]
Right here, right now, I do declare
That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player
I swear I ain't never told on nobody
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark
You feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
Try my best to rewrite this plan
As-salamu alaykum, sir
Yeah, that's the plan...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama
And I'm rollin' with the Nation, but I've been doin' that
Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma
Make a change, and she said: ""baby, go ahead and do that""
Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it cause he show it
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
Haters...

The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live

But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone

I seen everything twice
Been around the world I seen every scene twice
Stompin' down in Tokyo, dippin' in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every color dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my (?)
I'm somethin' like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammi
Sippin' Chardonnay, makin' bills on my hands-free
Father Hood, now the actors can't stand me
Cause I own rap and I'm comin' for your day job
Until then, I'm chillin' at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
Cause without you, none of this is real

I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowin' sticky by the zips
And they can tell by how my rag hang, nigga this Crip
But I'm chillin'; it feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee
Coast to coast jettin', man I been doin that
What y'all just start ballin' Cuz? I been up out the trap
Poppin' P's with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got an office
Dockin' down in Monaco, churchin' with my folks
Bad Lucc had me dyin' when he fell up out that boat
My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
Cause without you, none of this is real

Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn'
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime

[Chorus]
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway

[Verse 2]
Better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now

[Chorus]
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating

I used to be just like you nigga
Before I got off in this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did do
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing
I went out and got my own ya feel me?

You know there is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' shit. There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'. Always a nigga hatin'. It's always somebody that's displeased with what you do. You can never make motherfuckers happy. There is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled. There is always some bitch on the sideline talkin' shit with her big mouth There is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda, woulda, shoulda - it's just... you understand me?

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

People used to say that you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
Not something that you run and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard a-talking to her man
Pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from fruit town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn't a had no reason to make this call

And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'

Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggas in Darby Twp
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact

When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop

My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown

[Verse 3: Bad Azz]
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon

With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak

To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played

Rollin' with a player 'cause that's what he was
And dedicated to his paper, Je-sus!
On his bitches hard as feezuck
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced Visas
They say it's cheaper to keep her, now baby, ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up
Now sit your ass in the treezuck
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her, or should I freak her?
I'll take the stronger, you can have the weaker
Speak when spoken to, yeah, I broke a few
And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you

Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death (Ooh wee)
Had to catch my breath, watch my step
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
And call a timeout before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the ""Wizard of Oz""
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
'Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it, homie, I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape

Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop

So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life

And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South

When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dolla
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin' out the Doggfather
'less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners

And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog

I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt

So if you want me, get me, got me
Should have shot him

Verse Two:
I'm slappin' bones
In front of my home
Choppin' game on the phone
Smokin' a zone
Big 6, big 5-3's with ya bitches
My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven

Chorus (2x)

Verse 3:
I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the ho-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'
There's just no way that she can tell me no
You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh)
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

Another one got locked, and we don't know
If he comin' home boy

Let them do them, take care of your own boy

But if they think the old me ever left
Then they don't really know me
And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G
You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D
But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my mama didn't want me
Too wild to be her child, and pops not around
Now all I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man and what not
How to break ounces into grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
Shit, you think I forgot? Nah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thank God every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
That made me who I am, the music and the man
Told me that I can before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
They say leave the streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all came down, my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live, in these streets

I've been acquitted
Put your hands up if you feel me
I represent it
Y'all know my praise is relentless

[Bridge: Isaac]
Coulda sworn that I was having the time of my life
I was turning up
I was turning up (Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!)
Had to turn it all around
Turn my wrongs into rights
Had to give it up
Had to give it up

Sippin silver satin while we smoked on the pin head
A couch was a nigga bed
Mary kept a nigga fed
Twenty first a nigga, yeah that's where a nigga live

Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
They got me plottin from the bottom
With the ??? ain't no stopin'
And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin'
Is the to much to ask fo', oh no
And I heard through the eastside you spend to get some dough
So when you get your funk, go take to the store
Take it to daddy rap cause hes a pro-fessional
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the flo'

Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge
Of all judges budge this
And put it in perspective all praises due, true
We are living in a world

And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come

Have you been mislead, since I asked you all to creep with me

Give power to me
Over temptation
In my hour of need
Say I'm not forsaken
Shower over me
All of Your patience

Been a sinner for a while now
All of Your forgiveness
I might not deserve it
Sort of known to wild out
Okay to let your flaws show
Nobody is perfect
Hard for me to bow down
I was taught to stand up to anybody, anywhere, for anything
My hood, holy ground
Street war for fun
Taught to walk through hellfire with the kerosene
So quick to turn it up a notch
Low profiles, spinning, burnin up the lot
Always got that new thing turning up ya block
Always drive-by shooting, hard to make it stop
Pray for me
I'm something like a work in progress
Somebody already know
Pray for me
We already knew I needed someone to save my soul

Let me be Your servant

Don't be deceived
By temptation of man
Realize, understand
That it's not your plan
That it's only God's plan (say what?!)
Do you really understand?
Open ya hands
Close em, praise Him
For all salvation
Give You the praisin'
Welcome to the party
So glad that you made it
My wrongs, my rights

Till we see that day

Reject it, or you take it
Be real, or you fake it
Mistake and be patient
I'm tellin' you now
Things gettin real in the situation, boy
Don't fake it

"I had seen a lot of niggers come up in this game
But never did they make the look so good
From candy cars to bright yellow bras
The gangster white walls and the wood

You see, there comes a time in a man's life
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game
Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place
Where everybody knows your name

[Snoop Dogg]

It's a cold game, I ain't been one to
Jump in and out of the range
Maybe an old school synagogue
Spinnin' the vision from which I faint

You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'
East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind
The state that I'm in is gangster bliss
This is what you're callin' a sis
Passin' them off quick, memories missed

I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money
Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'
In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's
Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether

A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll
And I never be questioned by some new young chump
Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk
Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?

Hold closer my hands from my throne
And I never be crucified within my own zone
Here is a very good reason to show love
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug

From almost goin' down for murder in '93
To keys all over the city bowlin' in Snoops league
I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter
Two sons, beautiful wife for starters

I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas
Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah
Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy
You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up

Like some loco, I earned my respect
Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check
But all in all, I did it, B, cool as a blind with a C
Leveled my life as I push away the groupies
Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy

Stopped drinking cause my liver act up

"[Snoop Dogg: Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in a over crowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggas plottin to gank
Cause if it's me, it's on (Sup, homie)
Loc, the Ese wit the black knights just got stole on
And he fell to the ground
Plus, his homie's ain't around so he better get a beat down
It's not a jack for his scratch nor his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
And left him with two black eyes
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch slippin' they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin' if I'm slippin' in these County Blues

1 - Niggas fuck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin', if you snooze you lose
You confused the fuckin system, when you need I be
Why? Cause it's this is gangbangology

[Snoop Dogg: Verse 2]
See the first verse got'cho ass scared
But hold up, you gotta take a trip upstairs
Where the fools always wonderin?
Young nigga, welcome (welcome)

{*interlude*}

[Snoop Dogg: Verse 3]
I be ""God damn nigga, what'chu gon' do?""
Stay down for yo grits cause he who slips, gets licked
And stuck, fucked and all that
Boy when you get out you betta not never come back
I tell you that'll make a punk hard
Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
Uhh, later that night, a whole 'nother fight
But it's aiight, cause it's a nigga and a white
But damn, the Ese's is deep
And it look like they straght tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Deputy Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga
You ran out on the brotha's
That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a ho (you'se a ho)
Uhh, and I'mma let you know (let you know)
I mean, niggas is bitches, when they get behind the wall
But I ain't talkin 'bout all y'all
Cause I know some niggas from the C-P-T
And some big homie's from the L-B-C and South Central
Niggas y'all know, y'all is the looniest
Keep it true and ya County Blues doin' this

I'm trying to visualize Snoop Dogg without being high

Aye baby girl you know I wanna stick it to ya
If it's cool with you, then light it up boo

Okay I guess I'll get fucked up""
So everything went according to plan
So I went up in this bitch up off of weed and hemp
She told me that she liked it, I told her that I did too
I said: you know DJ Whoo Kid? well bitch suck his dick too
And turn the TV on MTV2
So I can watch the Osbournes cause that's what I wanna do

Mmm, you remember so much
No we didn't, see if you can remember this shit

1982 now what was I to do
All I wanna do is claim RTC
Cuz all of my homies from ICG
So we gon do this thang for tha LBC
Cuz we all one love and yeah this tha dub
On my eleven gettin slicker
Buyin liquor from a non-liquor store
Quick to dick a ho and get tha big homie for a 64
He ain't gon miss it though
Cuz I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome
Now he's tryin to take my dome
Hangin out all in front of my home
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own
Now it's really on
Cuz I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit
Put tha switches on his riches
Now his bitch is my bitch
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip
But I won't hesitate to test another rep
See thats the plan I was brainwashed not to know
But nigga fuck what you goin through this 2-0
And by tha time I'm 17 if I ain't in tha pen
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin again
Ridin, hoo-bangin like Mack 10
Back on tha streets again and strapped in
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up
Nigga I don't give a fuck, nigga I don't give a fuck em
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin

Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang
It's all fair in tha gang bang

I mean will like livin it up, you know
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang

I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now
Not to mention tha homeboys locked down in tha p now
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break
Watch out for them hoodrats, snakes
Cuz E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst
Stayin at his girls spot on 21st
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst
Cuz he might not make it to tha last verse
But meanwhile back in tha p now
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep
We straight bangin

(Verse 3)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life, yeah right
What you join tha game for you lil busta
Now you wanna cross us out and disrespect us
Musta thought we was bustas or sumthin
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas
Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang
If you gon gang bang
Ya gots to be able to bang by yourself man
So whether you bangin for crip or blood
You better bang for sumthin young thug
Cuz you'll get banged on not by bangas
But by Johnny Law cuz they love to hang us (I hear ya)
I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch
I can't trip cuz she look like my daughter and shit
So I'm a load up my clip and go ridin high
And every police car that I see ridin by
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid
Drinkin to tha set and hope my dogg young have head
Throwin up DPG for L-I-F-E cuz thats all I see

Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight
Yes, these Hollywood nights
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out
Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it

I used to wonder what the funk was
The Bigg Homie said 'Give em what they want cuz'
I can't remember gettin high as a muthafucker
Walking by not saying hi to muthafuckers
Little mama told me, don't get it wrong its the truth, but I
Prefer to have a nigga like Soopafly
Believe me I'm goin all out
And niggas trip when they see me up at Dogg House
And every time the Bigg Homie comes through they rush
My nigga truck windows down, not the move, givin it up
We live it up, so we don't stop for shit
We Dogg House in your mouth, where the props for it, come on

A nigga like moos best not make that move
Unless, you rockin wit the Dogg House best
Affiliated, trust, no niggas fuckin wit us
Many hate it but at least they strapped wit heat

Thinkin they can fuck around wit the cost of the town
They love to boogie, uh
One tough cookie chocolate chip dip
Wit the rockin this bitch hit top wit this hip-hop

10-20-71, the day I come out
Two days later, I'm runnin' my mouth
Mom's put a bottle to my grill
I look her in the face and I say chill
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hoes-pital
On my way to the liquor store
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll
But before I get out the door
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo
He picks me up and sit me on the seat
And then he grabbed the phone and get to dialin' the police
I wanna run but I can't walk yet
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet
First trip in the police car
Cameras all around me as if I was a star
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and
That's what I'mma name you cause boy you be snoopin'
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's
Twenty days later I'm from R-T-C
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up
Havin' fun and stuff
You niggas don't want none of us

What's up homie (What's up cuz, where you from)

"[Chronic break]
Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes
Know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
""Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum!""
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga

[Intro: Taa Dow & Snoop Dogg]
We’d like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y

[Chorus: The Dramatics & Nancy Fletcher]
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

[Verse 2 - Kurupt]
Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something?
Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, It's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin'
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Til when? (Til the early morn')
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough

[Verse 3 - Daz]
Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Til I die, I'm still screaming out: ""bitches ain't shit!""
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
Then I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I smoke chronic til the day that I die

[Verse 1]
Now if you tired of the hard work
Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
And you still up in debt
Walkin' round town all strapped in
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo
All this deception on top of stress
You havin' more problems than a algebra test
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell
You chillin' wit yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up
Because you can't be out there doin' low
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
Even though I'm young, I'm kind of real good
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She glimpsing in the mirror and shit
'Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing and shit is

Just another day in me old neighborhood
Not bad meanin' bad but bad meanin' good

Shot for my head, I popped back but I missed 'em
So I kept shootin' 'til I ran outta shots
Then I threw my gun at him and I ran up the block
Swang them foes, bang them hoes

I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I to school from my moms apartment
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz
In front of his building witht the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some TV
[Gun Shots] Do my ears decieve me
No That's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you ain't cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs
And come home like a slob
So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

All these niggas always talking about
""They looove this"" And niggas got looove for you
Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga

Nigga you can't buy love at no corner store nigga
Love ain't got no price tag
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everything is cool
I pull about a G a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55"" television you know
And every once in a while I hear ""Just say no""
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accelerator scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was Warren
Later I found it was Dogg and his crew
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My brother is out of it but I'm still in it
On top of that I'm in it to win it
I can't believe that Dogg would dis me
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy
I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all I could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin shots hoping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
""Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They pointin they guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down two
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

Love is a motherfucka

Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car
And he actin' like it's his but you know it's not
Say he doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up
She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up
Say she doin' too much, yeah baby you doin' too much

I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb""
But guess who's callin', Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo
But I can't forget about him 'cause he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walkin' down the wrong lane
Tootin' on that cocaine, fuckin' wit that wrong thang
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce

Now if you're doin' for your family and you can't stand it
'Cause you know these mothafuckers tryin' take advantage

And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope
And he need to catch a mothafuckin' different stroke
Say he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much

We might throw a pool party every once in a while
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharin' the cock
Also, I believe in comparin' the cock
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
'Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she went down on me
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Ooh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homie up on game like a gangsta
But my homie fell in love and he banked her
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist

Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much
And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin
And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend
Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much

I'm livin' up in the hills, wine sippin' wit mills
I'm havin' major type of paper, I ain't trippin' off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, 'cause I'm startin'
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, 'cause I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?

Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw 'em a c-note

And only get to hit a cold shower
You fakin' like you're makin' more moves than Simpson
But frontin', pushin' buttons, doin nuttin' but sin

And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin' up yo' bill
Tryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel

But we got somethin old, and somethin new for y'all tongiht
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

[Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin motherf**kers tryin to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Usin my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause i'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's goin on
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryin to spit at my motherf**kin hoes
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and i'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherf**kin paws
Y'alls, niggas, better recognize
And see where I'm comin from it's still East Side till I die
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll f**k all ten
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin
I had your whole f**kin block bumpin
Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya

So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A f**kin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
I wanna see some panties droppin
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the f**k of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you f**kin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

Niggas looking at me strange
But I'm up on the game
I ain't f**king with them niggas no mo
Shit, I feel the same way y'all feel
Nigga, f**k death row (ha ha)
I cut em loose, send em juice
With visine in their cup
Catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck
It's the tale of a whale locked in a cell
On the streets he was the heat cause 'cause had major mail
Had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains
Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs
Nigga f**king off money, saving them hoes
F**ked off some money of mine
And bought me a white rolls
Living on wilshire in a penthouse suite
F**king bad bitches seven days a week
Colder than a motherf**ker but now I'm hot
Floss me a brand new suit from dionne scott
I guess I'm balling now
Money falling down
I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now
Doggy dogg come and get with the pg
Mr. calvin broadus could you please come and see me
But I ain't tripping, I'm just dogg pound cripping
Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping
Make my own beats, so f**k y'all too
And I'm down with the niggas from the you know who
We get to the point
Blaze the joint
Step into the party and holla at everybody
As long as the gin get mixed with juice
And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce
Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga, nigga what
Just because I'm having paper don't mean f**k
I once was in the same predicament you was
Thinking to myself ""damn should I kill 'cause? ""
But I know deep in my heart

Two wrongs ain't right
And it started from a fist fight
I only got one life to live
I'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids
You dig?
I'm trying to live long like my hair
Put the shit down, like fred estaire
I want to share my world
But how the f**k can I share it
Everytime I throw you something
You look at mine and compare it
Man, it's a cold shame
But it's a cold game
I ain't make the rules to this game
Look, all I know and all I do
Is try to come through with something new
Banging for you
So whatever you do, you like it or not
Because when your shit play out
I be back on the dope spot
My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said
""son get your money like that"" (get your money, man)
I sit alone in the zone
Face of stone
Live the live of al capone
A don corleone
Casually casualties, fatalities
And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me
Funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding
Eastside up, eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up)
This is portable something to f**k with your ear
Doggy dogg will appear to make it sound so clear
I f**ks it up, like I always do
And that's a trick
I'm saying some shit
To make the bitches want to suck my dick
See it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the dogg pound slang
Back up in the house and we just don't stop

I'm the coldest of the coldest, the dopest of the dopest
The smoothest of the smoothest and the locest of the locest
The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together
So kindly, and you can find me on the Coast with the most, layin' high post
Playin' it close with a bunch of thug niggas, drug dealers
Project fools, C-Murder pass them tools
Shit I'm 'bout to make these motherfuckers get up
I draw the line between yours and mines and make sure you don't get lit up
Hit up the motherfuckin' set when I dip
(Where you from?)
Dogg Pound motherfuckin' Gangsta Crip
Split wigs for a livin', everyday's Thanksgiving
Motherfuck y'all rides, we slides, nigga we dippin'
The tank's driven by the colonel Mr. Master P
Lil' Silkky, Mystikal, C, and me and Fiend
Nigga don't be trippin', cause we got my lil' homie in the cut
That's Soulja Slim nigga, he known for dippin', what's up?
(Don't let go)
We love to bang bang
And the rap game is just like the dope game
The minute you forget it - forget it, you bit it
But them niggas know when you ain't with it
That's when they get ignant'

Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin' and shit

Check this out man -
I'm the hardest of the hardest, the realest of the realest
See but I don't fuck with nothin' but G's, ballers, and killers
So pardon my expression G
If yo' bitch is seen with one of my niggas in the click
You best believe she done ate a gangsta dick
And you can't fault one of my niggas for that
Shit, we just a bunch of thug niggas, ex-drug dealers
The kind of gangsta ass niggas that your bitch love niggas
But don't do that to yourself cause I'ma tell ya
I love to plug niggas with the slug niggas
Now if yo' bitch way out of line
And you think about steppin' to Doggy Dogg, you better take your time
Cause you out on a limb fuckin' with Slim
And you don't even know that, cause ain't nobody told him that
I need to just show him that
Cause I'm a pistol packin', car jackin', hoe smackin' MC
I don't know why all y'all bitches is fuckin' with me
Fuck all my enemies, I'm chasin cheese with G's
Servin' tapes and CD's by the three's and ki's
Nigga, Biggie was large, and 2Pac was too real
They had homies with heat on the street and they still got killed
Now how the fuck did that happen?, I thought them niggas was rappin'
But in this real world, shit, murder keep thangs crackin'
Homicides, drive-by's, and kidnappin'
Shit, when you head up out the door, nigga don't forget your fo'-fo'
Never leave home without it, shit, why dogg?
Cause niggas everywhere gettin' rowdy and bout it, and don't doubt it
Real violence aside, just don't forget it
Cause like I said, when you ain't with it, them niggas get ignant'

You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel

Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place

There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot

Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!

Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hoes
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse

Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm takin em out!

[Interlude: Corleone]

[Verse 3: Soop Dogg]
I come through blastin', me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone,Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs

Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out

Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
You dont like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute

Everywhere we go they say ""DAMN""
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we dont care
We dont just say no we to busy saying yeah

Do I look like a motherfucking role model
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I dont give a fuck cause I keep selling
Yo what the fuck are the yelling

Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to [?]
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said ""FUCK YOU BITCH"" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga who's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I dont give a fuck cause I keep bailing

A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

[Verse 3: C-Murder]
Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters
I said ""See you later"" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back with the navy blue top
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know you're jocking my crew
We want to fuck you C
I want to fuck you too
You see No Limit niggas dont take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fucking with
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'm a smoke your ass

If you'd of just stay down and been a motherfuckers real partner you
Wouldn't have had tat problem
But seeing as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turning into a submarine, went under water came
Back up with a periscope looking at your bitch ass
Now you have no paper, and now you on a paper caper
Now you coming up to my face and you're saying ""Hey can I hangout"" I say
No cause you ain't got no clout bitch get out

Make a nigga wanna poplock on the flo'
And do the Boogaloo Shrimp and pimp the ho
I got to owe 'em my life cuz I'm a O.G
I got the love in the hood cuz I'm the big homie
I got the skills when it comes to rockin rhymes
So put your hands up to the sky, get yours, I got mines

And if you do, then keep on groovin' with that nigga D-O-double-G
We ridin' with the hat to the side of the ride
Y'all know how we do on the Eastside
You see the thing is we like to keep it harder
And we real party people just like Afrika Bambaataa
What do you want? Matter fact, what do you need?
Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint
So pass the bottle, ain't no need to squabble
And hand it to the little homie, let him have a swallow
It's a Eastside thang, nigga, bring yo ass

New pussy in the hood, shall I kill it? (Kill It!)
The way she got it poppin, no, it's probably hotter than a skillet
But baby don't tweak, like you ain't no freak, peep
I keep my game tight, it ain't no leaks
So we can keep this on the down low
And take a walk with the Dogg and lemme show you what the pound for
Candlelight and romancin'
If I can just get the last dance in at the mansion

With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon
That's how we represent it though

Rollin' down Fairfax
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
But it's all legal in LA
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians
Athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say ""Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya""
Yeah, I love showing you now

But you really need a girl who understands you (for real)

Yeah I run through the money, I ain't ran through
And I keep it a hunnid
Good head, down bitch, let him get in my stomach (uh-huh)

It was like a blind date 'cause I ain't see it comin'

We was both young till I turned him into a man
Bitches do it for the 'Gram but this really who I am
If you get up in a jam, I'ma come through with the bands
Yeah, my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I love you like that woman that carried you

Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at

Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
He's checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin? I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve
The best Kurupt's era, peep the terror, cuz it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we
Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got the juice like 2Pac
(plus I'm) rollin with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die cuz I'm servin and
They can't fuck with or see me I'm mass murderous
[Smokin indo, look out my window I suppose] Yeah
[Niggas don't understand how we kicks diffrent flows]
(I'm raw like news footage) I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
(Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched)
[Drop to your knees like a dog in heat]
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air

[Verse 5: Lady of Rage]
Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Beatin' yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?

[Outro]
[Snoop] Throw your guns in the motherfuckin air, we don't care
[Dogg Pound] Niggas don't give a fuck nigga
[Snoop] About nuthin at all, just my Doggs and clockin the grip bitch
[Dogg Pound] Niggas don't give a fuck nigga
[Snoop] That's why I can kick it so tuff, cuz when times get ruff, my

Album:  In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap
Song:   Freaky Tales

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggie all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin by a garbage can
The next young freak, I met was Red
I took her to my house and she gave me head
She like blowin dicks, is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Sherry
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece
She'll only start talkin bout signin a lease
I met a young tender, her name is Lori
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?
She had a best friend, her name was Janet
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam
The very next day, I saw her with her man
One week passed, and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back, and watch the ho just mop me
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta
A country broad from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat
But I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath
Bake, and, shake, ups
I met this freak in Vegas
She she said her name was Don-na
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na
I said, ""I don't pimp, or gigolo
I'm havin so much paper I don't need a ho
You can break yourself, but you can't break me
You never met a player like Snoop baby""
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'
She was down on her knees, beggin to blow
She's like another freak, named Renee
You get her all alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
And with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well!",Snoop Dogg,Freaky Tales,
"[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yea man, I heard you wasn't gonna do it no more
They said it was overwith for you
Overwith? shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg this is me
Back up in the place to be
I walk a bit, I blaze a jay
I talk some shit, hey hey hey hey
I'm going at baby
Listen close we gon' dream
And we gon' toast, this that year
When things was bad this that time
When I'm gon' smash getting cash
Is all I know, I think the year was '94
Or was it later really don't matter
Cause I gets cheese , I gets cheddar

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, Kurupt in the building
They funny style, aye Snoop
Punk motherfuckers in disguise I can tell
Soon as I see them when I rise in the spot
Gotti in the building everybody realized
Looking in my eyes niggas is surprised
What the fuck is cracking don't they know what's happening?
The next time this nigga get close, clap him
This nigga like a bitch moving so slow

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Just bring the beat back and let the shit bang
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I came to bang
I don't come to play I come to drop heat
And niggas like you get dusted in the streets
You just try to rap about what you know
And I'm gonna keep this shit way on the low
Me man my clique me and my crew
We come through this bitch and banging on you
You think you can fuck with us
But I don't think you'll fuck with us
See we the shit DPGC
For 20 years and thats all me

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
Bitch, run through the spot
Tipping the hit
Run and get all my money nigga I get
The bitches they love me and they stay on my dick
I'm rolling with dabs, little half [?]
Me and big Snoop getting that bread
Make them pussy lips spread
Bitches is crazy, they all on my dick
Loving my Mercedes what up bitch

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg]
I'mma show you motherfuckers whats a poster G
And let me get these niggas close to me
You can size me up, you can picture the frame
You can study my style you can write down my name
You can change up the beat and you can slow this shit down
You can try to get close but this is still Dogg Pound
We be fuckin it up, we be smoking the dope
We be on the tour bus from coast to coast

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Got all my money, all my hoes
Every corner, all my hoes
All my homies, all my souls
Like what's crackin, and they know
In a second niggas get hit then it's over
Look look, why these niggas trippin all over
In the spot with my homies deep with heaters
Looking at these suckers pulling out they millimeters

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
So y'all should know when you stepped up
You got fucked up and that's what's up
See this is true we gray and blue
DPGC I thought you knew",Snoop Dogg,Freestyle,Kurupt
"[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Homie]
Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Wuz up home?
Word is on the streets, your beats gon' be delicate
Since Dre did shake the spea's out, man
Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat

(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

[Interlude]
One of every five black males before the year 2000
Will be detained or deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, if you're scared, go to church

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret

[Interlude]
Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
They got me runnin' for my life, I'm jumpin' gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me ""Have I seen the suspect?""
""Yeah, he went that way"", now for the jack",Snoop Dogg,Freestyle Conversation,
"It's time to slow it down, steadily grindin
And this is, the big Doggy Dogg..

And I ain't talkin about no Air Force Ones
I just gotta know, before you let me get some

[Hook]
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
I got to know, or you could show, me
Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong
I got to know, or you could show, me

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Freak-a-leek, peak peak
Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo
Let's see what we can do
I'm bout freakin you, and sneakin you
Into a quiet place
So I can look at it face to face
Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton
I can tell, cause you like squattin
Your last dude, he was so rotten
And now your love is to be gotten
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind
But what I'm really tryin to do is read between your pantylines
I know it seems oh so personal
But I'm just tryin to make you feel real comfortable
I know, so, what will it be?
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troublin me
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?
I got one question, answer me this then

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You came by the church with a whole lot of body
Got invited to our annual pajama party
Workin that lace, I think it was the French cut
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
Hidin it, should be dividin it
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it
And slide in it, real smooth like
With a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like
Zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to get your groove right
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you gon' let a nigga have a look at it?
Callin all cars, yeah baby girl you a star
But it's on you if you wanna go real far
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps
I, have one question, answer me this

Life is much mo' precious
Than you'll think
Like a game'll make yo chips sink
It's so hard
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Keep my head up and stand tall
If I stumble, then I'll fall
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
That we can call friends
Ohhhhhhh
[Goldie Loc]
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind
But I'm kind-hearted
And don't like being stepped on
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody
But you know what I never do?
Smoke it off like Gotti
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones
Tray Deee & Snoop, we sound good on this microphone
I never threaten nobody to make it happen
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'
But if I had a chance to give it back
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that
Do that, straight from the heart
Eastside till I die
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life
[Tray Deee]
It's a trip how we Crip
Suppose the enemies still
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears
Insane's and 20's both from the same city
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many
Me, C, and the G can think back to the start
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park
And having a heart
To get 'em up if it was beef
Head up like G's, take it out in the street
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke
A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close
And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now
Cause I could never see you doing bad without
And that's real

Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast
In the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless

I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch

And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are ""Contagious"", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home

But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n

The boss in the building, feeling so cold
If this was Houston I'd be feeling so throwed
I'mma stand up, you better man up
Who going home with Dogg?
Put your hands up
Puff pass and slide, you know the deal ho
I'm 10 shots in, that's on the real though
I got money love, and I ain't never scared
Watch your bitch mayne, it's pimping everywhere
I got a lot of bad ones, yeah you see the troops
They get to popping off, until they see it's Snoop
I'm loc'd out, the vodka all in me
Baby got the henney, and we from rolling twenties[?]
Turn it up boy, high as a bitch too[?]

If you see me in the club and you know I'm turnt up

Before you come fucking with me
Cause I'm full of that shit

[Verse 2]
Eyes so glassy
Bitch in the club, tryna harass me
I'm a taxi
I take her home, like a dog do
And cover everything, like a fog do
Bottle after bottle, nigga I'm turnt up
My eyes getting low, swisher burnt up
These hoes on one, tryna press a player
Balling overseas, nigga I'm heavy there
Leaning to the side, mixing all drinks
Dubs up in here, like a gold mink
This long beach bitch, d-o-double-g
Since 93', on top of V.I.P
Watch your look mayne, the stare make it worse
I understand I'm famous, but I'm a gangster first
You better get him mayne, I'll beat his ass quick
I'm off the wall bitch, I'm full of that shit


[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Got my rag hanging, like Snoopy do
Sound like a hater, like Snoopy who?

Fire it up, go on pass it round
I smell the kush fool, I'm like a basset hound
Yeah I'm rich, nigga and what?
Still [?]'d up, nigga that's what's up
Pour some more in, cause I can handle that
I'm in a Pontiac, she said where the phantom at

[Mac Minista]
Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted an ""alpha""-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts
Of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's
The anti-player has filed and submitted an ""alpha""-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless endangerment
From the million dollar mouthpiece;
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an ""alpha""-davit
In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension
So all you jerks with them $11 words
Comin out of your $2 mouth
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack - I said
He's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal",Snoop Dogg,Game Court,Mac Minista

The Scene: Long Beach yeah '86
Where: The liquor store nigga on some devilish shit

My homeboy got away but shit I wasn't tellin'
So I fell in a trap with no getback
They threw away the key and now I'm a OG
In the County jail rappin and bangin' at the same time
And since I don't smoke cigarettes loc
Shit I gotta slang mine
And I ain't tryin' to get on swole so I ain't fuckin' with the iron
I got bitches bringin' me money and ain't a goddamn thing funny

Get ya respect on at all times nigga hustle 'til ya ball
Watch them hatas and pretendas and all the shit they do
Cause nowadays some of these niggas be bitches too
Keep the business professional get ya heat at all times
Keep them snitches on the sideline
Cause you know pressure burst the pipeline
Keep ya eyes on ya enemies watch those close to ya
See them outside niggas can't touch ya
It be the ones inside that do ya
Smilin' in ya face but want to take yo' place
Fuck around and be playa let's make a deal with the D.A
Don't be ridin' with no niggas
Who ain't sure if he gon' get down
Cause it only take a split second
To get ya buck buck and lay down
Hesitation'll buy ya fate get that ass all caught up
Ya little homey might be cool
If them other two priors ain't brought up
Remember took time to kill smash and don't give a fuck
Be a hog about ya papers straight hungry for that der come up

These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right

Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggas locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on

So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me ""What's that?""
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, would like to say
That I'mma crazy mothafucker when I'm playin' with my A.K
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out

You don't like how I'm livin, well fuck you
This is my gang, nigga, No Limit

With the pow pow, bang bang (*gun shots*) and you're dead
And then we stamp that Tank on your forehead
Every where we go they say ""DAMN""
Them gangsters, they be fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeaaaahhhhhh
About drinkin' straight out the seven bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Shit, life ain't nothin' but weed and money

Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my double pointin' at his window
He got scared and hit the gas ""Damn""
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to Snukes
Sweatin' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't no play, from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Navs, bitch you crazy?
She was scared and it was showin'
So we all said ""FucK YOU Bitch"" and kept rollin'
To the hood, now we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
Gettin' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack
On a nigga follow nothin' at all

Tell her husband that there's another man
And she say that I made her fall in love
I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was

Baby like the way I wake her up (why?)
Cause I'm a gangsta, I grab her by the butt (oh)
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep
Everyday, it's the same thang, I creep in
It's like ""True Blood"", I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it, the L.B. raised me

Bitches upset with me (why?) Cause they can't get no dick
I'mma be on top of the game whether I'm, broke or rich
I don't stop once I'm on top I just drop mo' hits
I'm in the club with the thug, I just pop mo' Crist'
Tell Snoop to get the Coupe his new shit I just, gots to go get
Cause when I cock my shit, usually I pop my shit

I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cutthroat on the down-low
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight",Snoop Dogg,G Bedtime Stories,

Get it good, get it fast
All spark, all ass
Hit it 2 times, puff puff pass

Young Gotti, get it Gotti
Somebody in here smellin like hot karate
And that’s the way you comin up in this
No homo, and you expect to crack a bitch
Game for ya, good to ya
Then it’s still ‘fore you crack a bitch and let er spoil
Man I got bitches by the dozen tho
Didn’t know it, fucked er wrong and cracked my cousin’s ho
Superficial, so official, like a referee’s whistle
Test the G, test to me, next to be test the pistols
Coming off the deep dark circle of the VP
Gray and blue since you knew a Snoop ’92 or 3
This is how the motherfucker west is won
Ox cock to knock out his oxygen
Cuz we get it good, get it fast
Move, dance, everybody sag

[:Chorus]

[:Snoop Dogg]
Uhh, what a nigga really know about getting money out of this?
To the house, turn ‘em out, real shit
Gave a bitch real dick, that’s it, what a pity
Now she workin at sin City, poppin it, droppin it for cash
How long this shit gon last?
I move fast, grab me another ho
Yellow and thick, I’m drinking on tequila
Drapped in all feela, rollin my weed up
Click on seeder, straight off the meter
3 stripes for life, I’m paid my Adidas
Fly senioritas, good time to meet us
4-20 after dark, down by seritas
Home of the Steelers, cat feelers and dealers
Or I’d own a bitch, no lane, for whip up hillas, killas
They kill in the day time, wanna be seen
I’m on a bad bitch, with a purse full of green
We grew up on the same blunt but we’re not the same kind
Game over, nigga it’s game time
I swing mine like a 6 deuce turnt up
Til it get loose I’m on the blunt, she on the pill you bitch
You…

One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice,laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, And dick you up!
Give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
And then it got worse, cus now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Now it ain't no thing, cus she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said ""Look here bitch you've had
Enough""

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
(Say What, Say What)
Come on, Now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up
(What Chew Say, What Chew Say) YAH

I'm hopped by the ice cream shop, The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me
Were's Serv-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle
Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank
Tryin' to find all your dope, cus your a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
Cus times gettin' hard on the boulevard, but I refuse to loose ?!?!?!
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some

Josey Wales was known for robbin' trains and banks
Layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
'Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[Verse 3: Techniec]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hoes be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Verse 4: Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they peace-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Tryin ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it
Reinstated but still kept it gang related
I traveled the globe, private jets, and Versace robes
Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
Tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air
And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
No bizaar, what a lovely pair
And they all came here just to fuck wit a player
Anytime I wanna jam, shit I'm runnin' through these hoes
Like a pack at the Coliseum
Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley

You done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good
Stop, now , top down through the neighborhood
Let the wind blow, open up the window
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe
We have a barbeque to do at four
Swimming pool party in the back on the low
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free
Little kids get down, I’ll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt
Playing mama dear, calm and clear
This that time of the year
For everybody to be boisterous
Rock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this

Shined up my white walls, night falls
I'm feeling hella good
I'm doin thangs that you never would
Like surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark
Riding on a bike with my grandson at the park
Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard
We go, till we can't go no more
It's me and mines, it's summertime
You go off and we go on

The baddest of them all, the hash is why I won't fall
Molasses can't match my crawl, I'm higher than all of y'all

Beotch! (Beotch!)
I come through with the humps, I'll thump the shit out your block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spotted some hoes, tooted my horn at the bitch
The Riviera skated, my interior's the shit
Fifteens humpin', dropped the top some more
Countin' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo
Floss through South Central, I'm on my way to the Eastside
We high, blazin' like crazy and don't know why
Feelin' good as fuck, on a hot ass day
And there's a pool jam right around the way
Niggas got hoes, but ladies in the world
They wanna play with their minds like little girls
I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair
Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny cause I get pretty
It's all about game...
Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'
So tell me how much money can one playa make?
And how much ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (ya know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (ya know)

I was off in Vallejo
Peelin' hoes like Idaho Potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
Bein' from where I be - D.P.G
It's manifico, ran into this pretty ass skirt
Mexi con Puerto Rico
Mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'mma approach her like that
And let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone, the place that I call home
Is the world from Philadelphia to Rome
Picture me ey, entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin' tours and we still young boys
We got bitches, they got some bomb ass lips
She used to put 'em on this bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

Hey girl, what's your name? You wanna go a couple rounds with me?

So let me scoop you, swoop you, and take you
Give me a chance, and I'mma break you -

With my homies from the Dogg Pound

Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away, get away with all your cash
You gots to stay up on your toes when it come to hoes
I bust a brand new ho at every video
That's on the Pound and the Row, and like the wind blow -
I pass a ho to my kinfolk - and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin' juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
But before she do me, I blaze up a doobie
Then turn on some Snoopy and uh - heat up jacuzzi
And, later on I just might turn on a movie
So you can regroupie and re-do me, just for Snoopy

You know how she loved to sucked a niggas dick

Where she thought she was gonna be getting
Some here and there
I told her I wasn't tryin to have that
And the bitch wipped out
So check this out

Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg

I'm at home, layin low
Everything is everything waitin on my hoe
I know its hard to imagne that a nigga on my status
Had a night like tonight look here I'm glad
Came to an end
My girlfriend slid into the bedroom with a woman
Come in, is what she said closed the door and jumped in the bed
Baby would of gave a nigga head insted of flippin and trippin
I run along with the PG, hm
And that's on DP
I mean what could I say, what could I do
Anything I say and do is a catch 22
And I knew I had a clue
Of some type of suspion
Tuesday night when I see you up at peanuts fishin'
I wasn't really trippin
At first I wasn't gonna go dippin
Then I said damn look at all these bitches
I went inside couldn't believe my eyes
Snatch up four fly bitches, time to ride
Tell by the earl pull the Bently in front
Hit me with a G thang, fuck a blunt
Ridin at the highway, thangs is going my way
Tell the bitches that we be goin to my place
Fellin like Teddy Pendagrass on the freeway
Get my dick knocked off, in a G way
Yea they know the program is set
And lovin each other and lovin my dick
It's a trip but I don't see nothin wrong with it
So you can work your thang which is Snoop
And I'ma sip this drank, thank and recoop
Cuz when you close the bar down
You know what {you know what}
Baby you a star know

Hook 2X: Snoop w/ chorus
I can't fuck no head doctor
I don't give a fuck even if the bitch is proper
She might be cute, she might be thick
But she will get G'd if she don't suck dick

Verse Two: Swoop G

Man I wanted to fly
When it come to what these women say
You know I'm the coldest
Cuz I spit that shit you niggas thank
Like proper, pimpin', prevence for preformances
I have my baddest bitch go get my grip
Go walk the strips, her ten toes touch the payment for mine
You know the time, cuz when it's time to make the payment  of mine
My bitch grind, make that G's stack come back and gimme that
All of that proper amount yea, my full count
And now she wants to have sex with me
I told her please sell my piece make my portion a fee
And I'm put you in position for victory
As long as you follow directions carefully
So I flossed her for a month, nephew you know whats up

Boss up muthafucka and you can pimp that

I wanna be inside of you

Verse 1:

Wash my clothes you hoes clean up the kitchen
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them bitches was vicious
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the booty
Oops, slid it on the accident
But, when I first met her she was so innocent
So it made no sense how she suck dick for fuck of it
We did it on the wall, me and my dogg
And I met her at the mall
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you
Make you wanna come back and get another piece
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket
Ride it, devide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it

Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you

Verse 2:

Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list
Unless you wanna be the girl that fill that void
And grow with a real G homeboy
I take you where you wanna be
And I strip you buttnaked right in front of me
Think I hop, beauty for that there, can see
On the floor, at the mo' gettin low
Two thirty real dirty I we ain't leavin em fo'
Close the do' and turn off the lights
I love it when you coochie me extra tight
Got you screamin dynamite, like Jay Jay
Hey hey, girl that's what happenen'

Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?

You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you [2X]

Verse 3:

I had a chick named Shamai, she love champagne
What a little twist the thing Alaine
She wadn't from America, so she couldn't speak English
I wipped out my ?zizag? and baby spoked dinglish
Reminds me of the supper free, that I bumped in Frisco
Same week buzzing another one up in Fresno
Hey ya'knaw, it seems that they knew what time it was
I've got a glass of Hurricane to get them all buzzed
Had them doin all type of craziness
And one freak said ""All I wanna do is get a homegirl ???""
I flipped, for a second, look here I wrecked it
They gotta have that po-po, ?????????
They be we twisted, in case you missed it
See we gone keep this on the DL, It's our lil' secret
I won't tell, if you won't tell, see
Cause you gone work your thang, BANG BANG

I wanna be inside of you

You know you gotta have heart

If I'm still in it I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool

I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth
And it'll catch on
Cuz if it don't it's on
And cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone
Sittin back laughin' in the chronic zone
Clown me, you're wrong
Surround me, you're gone
And it's the same old song
Nigga paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get him, got him
Shoot him, shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti

Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin
But I wasn't slippin I was on deck

Dead gone lights out

I'm laughin at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin with the dogg I take your life and your money
And now I dip too my spot
And set up shop with yo rocks
And bet nobody speak on the 8-7

Cuz she like that song that the bow wow sing

But I'll put her on a hoe stroller, make me some green
And even if she never even saw me before
There's just no way that she can tell me no
'Cause my game's unbelievable baby
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

From basketball to alcohol, everybody love the Dogg
I'm sure Billy Clinton probably got a Doggystyle tape
Somewhere hidden in his briefcase

Take a look you ain't ever seen
One hip-hop rapstar drop this West Coast rap-cord
Back to the spot up top
West Hills for real, give it up to him (WC)

With blue Colion playin' in the background
On the behind line with big style

There's some hoes in this house
If you see 'em turn ’em out
There's some hoes in this ho-ow-ow

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Bitch, why you looking at my dick?
Acting like you wanna blow a dick
Yeah, I know he know a bitch
Got my homie, and we all out to get laid
Seen this bitch on stage
Live, right, get it goin', don't stop
Panties drop, hit the floor
Don't act like you new to this hoe, I seen you before
Yeah, you don't remember me, cause I ain't have no loot
Now bitch, you tryna act cute
Pull up your skirt, do it like it's ’sposed be done
Ain’t no fun if the homies can't have none
And after we get to ya, get with ya
Get through ya, stick dick to ya
Got my niggas in here motivated
Heated, gang related
[?], and it’s like this
[?] bitch

[Verse 2: Daz]
This is for my homeboys
Let's show 'em how we get-get down
Show 'em how we -get down
Show ’em how we beat it to the beat of Tha Pound
Don't mind, it's just a pimp thang
Money with me every time, it's a grip thang
Short and simp' thang, get it like you want it
With the shake of Dogg on it
Go on do it like you want it
Baby lick it good-
Hip, big tits, shit's so thick
Baby flossin' that kitty, I ain't bullshittin' bitch
Go on, do what ya gotta do, baby lick it so tend'

[Chorus: Snoop]
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (when you see 'em, turn 'em out)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Trip, now Daz, Luke, Kurupt, and Snoop
Come bangin' all the hoes in ya muthafuckin' group
It's a shame, how my game
Gon' get that pussy for me in a minute mane
There's hoes all over this place, I bumped a hoe from Atlanta
Named Nevanah, and I, ran a, plan up
That I had designed for another bitch named Savannah
Man I, had a lot of hoes in my lifespan
Even had a bitch from Iran named Jan
Not to mention Japan, I had a tight-eyed hoe with dough
Ya know? Fo' sho'
Now ya know I can bump 'em
So when they get out of line I won't hesitate to dump 'em
Cause I was taught not long ago
In order to gain a hoe, you gotta lose a hoe
That's why my stable, keeps me able
To buy nice cars, homes, and cables
Gangsta haters, a question for y'all
Why yo' bitch paws in my draws, holding on my balls?

[Bridge: Kurupt]
You act like you don't do it
But you know ain't nuthin' to it
Don't play like you ain't been through it
Fit to blow dick like ain't nuthin' to it

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
One for the money, two for the hoes
Seen 'em all coming, they coming in rows
Bitches ain't shit, so I suppose
Your bitch is different, in different clothes
Hell nah she ain't, she's just an average hoe
That gives the average dick the average blow
Don't play, don't look at me that way
Don't switch, I know a bitch when I see a bitch
I know a hoe when I see a hoe
DPG done get blowed in some [?]

[Verse 5: Daz]
Baby sit back, with your bad self
You ain't never ever had a piece of ass n'em
Once you get it butt-nekkid get to mackin' 'em
And she worked it on a nigga so [?]
I get nasty, when you least expect
Get fine drunk hoes to get butt-nekkid
We don't be trippin' when walk inside the club
Find me a freak by the name of love
She love, wants a girl that like that dick
Plus like that clique and like freaky shit
You wonder why we bring these hoes
These types of clothes, so we suppose
Spit this game, once you think you know it
These freaky hoes is good to go

[Chorus: Snoop]
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)

[Verse 6: Snoop]
Man, this nigga right back in the club looking for some love
Standing at the bar with a pocket full of dubs
Paying some bitch, to make your dick get hard
Cause you's a muthafuckin' trick
I gets, niggas like you's on the regular
Send a hoe at ya, then look at ya
Right where I want ya at
Make sure you won't get no get-back
I learned from the best pimps in the game
I got hoes all over, my best hoe's Nova
I know ya tried to come over
And get at her, it really didn't matter
I had her, ready to cock back the hammer
And jam her, 9-double-M in your face
While you dance to the boogie of the bass
You chase hoes, I place hoes in they place, nigga

Now let me tell you som' right, a lot of niggas don't understand (nah they don't understand) how real pimps and real players handle their shit (they don't understand, know what I'm talkin' about)
Ya know, aye, me and my man, Dogg (tell 'em), you know we just puttin' hoes in they place, we pimpin' hoes (pimpin' hoes), laying hoes down (slamming Cadillac doors)
You know, a hoe is gonna be a hoe (hoe gon' be a hoe)
Some of y'all niggas don't understand that (yo' hoe be a hoe, let the hoe be a hoe fool)
So, so don't act like you don't do it (cause you know ain't nuttin' to it), cause you know ain't nuttin' to it

I put it all together, and rock it till it chump
Then bag it up and sag it up and then serve
I'm always on the pager, never on the curb
I'm big time, get mine, stay down for the grizind
I keep it gangsta, nigga, all the tizime

The boys right there with the gold in they mouth
They'll tell ya (tell ya)

Now all the bitches if you with me, come get me

That's the old fashion way, and bring a friend with ya
So when I'm through with ya she can hit ya
Shit I ain't trippin'
I'm dippin'
There's money to be made
It's funny how she layed when I told her she couldn't stay
Look here, my boo'll be through
So you gotta raise, boy game pays
On the next phase, gotta show to do at 4
Then I'm headed right back to the studio
If you need the hook up
Give a nigga a holla
I slide through your hood, in the gold impala
Drop off a sack, then I head right back
And I hope I don't get jacked, cause you know I'm ridin' strapped
But if the boys decide to pull me over loc
They recognize my face, and so they go

"Man I had a crazy crazy dream dogg
I had a dream I was in the NBA straight playin basketball
NBA straight getting my ball on dogg
Can you imagine?
Snoop Dogg in the NBA?
Imagine that, Hoop Doggy Dogg
Yea straight ballin
You know I'm a ball anyway so why not
Let me get my ball on

If I could play in the NBA
I would be that six-four all day shootin that trey
I dribbled to the outside and passed it to Shaq
They double teamed on him so he passed it back
Look at the 3 but I don't take the shot
Cause I think I'm cold and I ain't trying to get hot
I'm feelin bionic, we playing the Sonics
And I'm sticking Gary Payton so you know I'm ball hatin
Bang on Vin Baker cause real Lakers really don't care yea yea
Next stop in the court on Damon toast Stouda and my homeboy J.R. Rider
Minnesota Timberwolves, we cut 'em down
Hakeem Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen, we shut 'em down
The Twin Towers, Dave and Duncan
20 in the paint fool you get's nothing
On a four game roll sweep, beep beep
We beat the Bulls and we rocked the Heat
And we traded for a few players, some Pacers
Miller and Mullin and now they Lakers
We can't be beat now, we on a 27 game win streak now, bow wow
When it all started from a dream
I'm playin point guard on my favorite team (Lakers)
I got the big perm, doing interviews with Chick Herm
At Stu Lance, we do a dance
When it rains poppin shampane
Basketball yes yall thats the game
Two years ago a friend of mine
Ask me to glide from the free throw line
So I took the ball, and as I made the hoop
Everybody jumped up and they said ""Go Snoop""
And my career jumped off into the fast lane
My rookie season I made my first all star game
Double G like George Gervin, thats what the call me cause I'm so ice
Ballin cause that's my life, I balls all day, and I balls all night
They call me Snoop Dogg and everybody know I love to hustle and ball
The season gettin tragic we lost to the Magic
And the word is that Rodman done had it
So I guess it on a young homie, the great number 8, Mr. Kobe
Give him the ball dogg he ready
We got to play Charlotte tonight, I'm stickin Eddie
Remember all the good times that we had
Cuz dont trip to long cause tommorow we play the Jazz
Then it on to play the Denver Nuggets
The homeboy Nick they traded, but damn I still love 'em
Keep a picture of 'em on the wall next to Dr. J
Meach, I love basketball
Allen Iverson on the fly boy he hard to stick
C Webb comin through with a quick pick
The NBA Saturday mornings hey or maybe on a Sunday
We in the playoffs so stay off the court
This ain't no game, this a sport
And we in it to win it, we ballin, No Limit
Remember this
When I grow up on wanted to be a point guard playing on NBC
With Herb and Suge or Pistol Pete or World B. Free givin dap to me
Givin up my dues with converse shoes
And tellin all the kids to stay in school
This is true and your dreams can come true
If it happen to me, it can happen to you

That's for all the NBA players that dream of being a rapper
I'm a rapper that dreams of being a NBA player and I'm a baller
Let's bounce up out of here man",Snoop Dogg,Hoop Dreams (He Got Game),

That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz

Ask them hoes over there, ""Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?"" (yeah!)

And from the looks, I could tell she had been under the needle
Dr. Miami, used to be slim, now she all beef patty
Damn Tammy, I see ya got it goin' on witcha weave too
You say it's all yours, yeah I believe you

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis]
You got weave in yo' hair, I don't care, I don't care
Yeah, you say you got a man, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care

[Verse 1: Snoop]
Yeah, who smokin'? who drankin'? who fuckin'?
Cause, it really ain't about nothin'
Push the button if ya down with the PG
My nigga Fly did this beat, this shit is greasy
He holla'd at me about turnin' this mutha out
Met a nigga in Chi-town at the Bishop house
No doubt, Midwest Side, with the nutty East Side
Had no other choice but to make it rizz-zide
Now I gotta slizz-zide, bizz-ack up in traffic
I got the boombastic, hit you off with a classic
Terrifically, police doggs be sniffin' me
That's probably why I catch a private jet like frequently
This is ineek-quity, nah it's inequity
That's when you put your money down on some property
And get ya chips right, and move like monopoly
And do this shit properly, ain't none of y'all stoppin' me

[Verse 2: Guerilla Black]
Uh-huh, yuh
Caucasians say I'm so amazin'
But all the niggas be like ""that ain't Nathan""
Hell, you dealin' with a monster
Talk shit, I'll hunt ya
Like a predator, I kill all competitors
Nothin' does a body more better than ten shots
Break his bones with the bat, wrap him in glad lock
Find a stash spot where the smell don't seep through
Or alibi the titty bar, the girls well see through
Come near, see how I drop chips on the Buccaneers
I know you hate us, heart broke up like the Raiders
Up in San Diego, I got the ticket high
Cause I got to fly way up in Waco
Peruvian yayo, freshly imported
Take a tool, burn ya nose off like [?] nigga

My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
Be about your paper nigga take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfuckin rookie
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on this dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch i’m on that

[Hook]
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, thats why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
Fuck one that once sucked my dick and find another (bitches)
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them(bitches)
No, I don’t wine and dine them

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Hell no, I don’t need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
(I don’t need no bitch bitch bitch)
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me

She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee
She taught me everythang, except how to see a G
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me

Geah, first of all
Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Sing it sister..
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G
Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

[Snoop Dogg]
In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
And dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggas around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
I found myself grindin on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a Glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggas throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called 'pop' by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
So if you get back to the streets you go right back in
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryin' to keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop

With your ears, clear your mind – can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?

Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked you ""What you run for?"" and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun, though
But you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said 'fuck this shit'
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in the jail, dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you 50 million records
Worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

[Hook: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind – can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?

With your ears, clear your mind – can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?

Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit

You the real, you never will slow me up
And you was always on my mind
Say no more
I still miss you at times
All of a sudden you lost my interest
I packed it up and set about my business
You used to have a hold on me
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
I kept going to jail and all that

I like it... make me realize my vices

"[Intro]
Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song
(she was in love)
A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug

[Chorus]
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta

[Verse 2]
Mm.. I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew
That I gotta do and I'mma miss you Boo
But I'mma write you every night and call you on the phone too
Whatchu gon' do? ""You know I'm gon' stay true
But I'mma go ahead to college like my father want me to""
Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind
And I'mma call you back tomorrow round the same time
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short
On another phoneline, holla'n at my other ho
This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT
Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap
Niggas watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)
Never caught slippin, always on strap
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin get back
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college
She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways
She fell in love with the local G
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me

[Chorus]
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)

Everything fine
In G-O-D we trust
That's why ya'll suckers can't ""Touch us, Touch us""
Meech u made the beat
And you know when we get together
Shit, we like bread and meat
We coming with the heat
Close your mouth cause Dogg House is definitely turning it out
And what about the cops?
I paid them and the ones I didn't I slayed them, haha
Will it ever stop?
It's like asking ""Who is it"" before a nigga even knock
The game is here to stay?
And I'm here to change the rules cause I'm a player that loves to play
Did you thank the lord today?
Think I did and on that note young loc, I'm getting ghost
Why you tell the truth?

To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun
I'm torching hot and all the same
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown

Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O

Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game
He so sprung, on top of that he young
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game
Now they 'bout to take him out the game
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll slow

[Hook]: Kurupt,(Snoop), [*some singing in the backgound*]
I'd rather not get shot
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive

[Technique]
(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted
But I'm unlisted in the books
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW!
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard 'til I win
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green
And all my life I got advice from a superior team
I gotta stay away from the casket
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso-
Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e [*echoes*]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, smooth and imperial
Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials
Time's getting drastic, man I'm a flas it
Dogg Pound Gangstas' choking off that boombastic
Have you ever heard?
I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime?
Sometimes I used to pack, one time I got jacked by some sacs
But you know I got mine, you know about the Don Corleone
I'm-a survive and thank God for Lil' Spanky B. and Bone

Off of Jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the U-turn
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
Nigga talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff (what's up nigga)
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo
Lettin off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
(Fuck them niggas) Well there's some hoes over there
And I concentrate on the haters later (what)

"[Intro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

[Verse One: Mack 10]
What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg X2]
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people; do you wanna get funky?
Get down.. get down.. you know..

[Verse Two: Bad Azz]
Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case; any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find;
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

[Verse Three: Techniec]
It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

[Interlude: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uhh..

[Verse Four: Kurupt]
Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents; disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific; niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west; where it's about your money and your set

[Verse Five: Deadly Threat]
You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs
Keep it real though!",Snoop Dogg,Keep It Real,"Mack 10, Bad Azz, Techniec, Threat, Kurupt"

Just to keep you in a fix for 1996
Just to do the thangs that I'm normally doin'
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic and I'm still here pursuin'
I'm climbing the charts, breaking hearts up the way
Just to do the thangs like I do back in the day
I make my pay the same way, I'm on the same type of mission
Leaving niggas in the cold, man I got a story told
Rolled, no need to fold up ya paper yet
I got the music, so use it, to get ya neck wet
I catch ya slippin', dippin', now my  flippin'
Got the whole crowd saying: ""boy, bow-wow terrific""
As I kick it, as I'm supposed to
Get you in a twist, and twist like I wants to
And get ya up out ya ways, as the record plays
Put on a little something from back in the days

Now, it makes me wanna get up
It makes me wanna sit up
I got the joint in my hand
I light it, now it's lit up
Now I'm 'bouts to write a, better yet, I writ a
It's Snoop up on the microphone and now I'm getting rid of
All these sucka emcee's who be clogging the game up
I'm back on the block but I ain't come with the same stuff
I sacked it up differently, in fact, specifically
Game so cold it left Jack Frost' nose froze
Now, you knows and I knows how the story goes
All the ladies say ""hey"" and the niggas say ""ho""
While they sippin' on a 100 proof
All my niggas in the VIP boo, hollin' ""woof""
Cause Snoop is back, back like Return of The Jedi
Nigga don't say shit, cause I
Already said I, be on the red-eye
Ya fat, ya black, ya wack, yo' style is tore up
Plus she got one dead eye
We move mountains and we rain like fountains
Make so much paper we need four accountants
So keep bouncing, bouncing, bouncing
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

We are party people

We are party people

Do ya wanna get funky? (uh-with who? uh-with who?)
Ugh, to the sounds of the Pound
Do ya wanna get funky (uh-get up, uh-get up, uh-come on)

Hey yo Cube, tell me this
Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch?
Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch

Yep yep, they love him to death
Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet
Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
So gone and so blown, are we there yet?
You wonder why I got the S on my chest

Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

[Butch Cassidy]
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got

I ain't never did it like this before

[Snoop - singing]
I'm the kind of G that everybody knows
But I'm so low-key, when it comes to hoes
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes
All my friends and foes - know that's just how it goes
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time
There's so much to say with so little time, but I like it
(Yes I like it)
I'm gon' dip dive socialize and get high
I wish my people had, other ways
I'm thankful, that a brother's paid (that a brother's paid)
But how can I be happy? My hair is still nappy
I miss my grandpappy
I wanna do right but the world is wrong
That's why I'm singin this song

[Hook]
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
Y'all niggas better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

You bitches better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

There's so much goin on out there in the world today
All these - ladies, players, gangsters, and suckers
I get caught up sometimes, some of the people I hang with
They turn out to be snitches, bitches, yeah they switches
But you know like I know I can't stop doin, what I got to do
I'mma keep doin what I got to (I'ma keep doin) y'know!
Everywhere I go, the game is the same
People lookin at me want me to say somethin
Want me to do somethin, but I don't know nuttin
If I ain't gettin paid, I can't drop no rhymes
I can't do nothin for you no mo', I ain't got that kinda time
And they know..

[Hook] w/ minor variations

[Snoop - singing]
I try to be to myself, and try to stay.. away from the world
But the world just keeps runnin after me (runnin after me)
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness
But somehow, the wickedness is in my circle - what am I to do?
I try to ask God to help me get through this
What am I to do to this? Just do this, let's do this
So I, continue to mash, day by day (day by day)
I continue to play, play by play
And I con-tinue to spit my manuscript (spit it)
And say what I want to say (say it)
And I do it to ya ev-ery-day

And he said i was the one, ha realizing the deal Heaven done
Turnin' to the east and all praise the sun
Now they blast me but they all miss
I do my 3D dance and remain undaunted
Then simply reverse the process
As the hot slugs hit their chest-plate, checkmate
Game over, you lose
Funky, drunken monkey technique without screws
As the sayin' goes, if ya snooze ya loose
And I won't be aimin' when the oozy ooze
Got em' runnin' for the hills
Style steady truckin' like eighteen wheels
Do got em' cluckin' like eighteen pills
The hex flies off then all the blood spills

Sharp as nails, tough as stones
This ain't based on no true story

Carry vocal tones, most definitely will
Cause more horror than Amityville
Get out, this my house
Got you scared niggas don't chew like a church mouse
When I swing the excalibur like Highlander
The head flies off you see thunder and lightening
Much too late to recognize your blunder
Suddenly you hear there can only be one, well just X
We apply wild west tactics like turn back-to-back
Take ten paces and draw, but I'm sneaky with mine
Turn around at nine and blast you in your spine
High-ride off into the hot sunset
Like the high plains drifter
Hear me mister, no one blast with the
When it comes to shootin' gives up
X marks the spot and guaranteed to lift up

Murder is the cold that Jimmy lays on these wicked ass streets

You thought I was gone, motherfucker I'm back home

I'll take you to the Necropolis
And place you in the front, remain calm through tis damn thang
Listen here man
Killin' after killin' dealin' after dealin'
You motherfuckers don't really know how I'm feelin'
But I can't waste time and reflect on that

Grab yo bitch that suck dick while I smoke
Then hang yo bitch using tape and rope

You see I really wanna get a little front with you
Biggidy bump with you
A nigga wanna hump you, and then just comfort you
And then I'll pop the top
And lay you on the cot, and get you nice and hot
Yeah yeah, it's all to the real
We could do it like Guy, come on girl, let's chill

[Chorus: Vanessa Marquez & Pharrell]
Can I get more thrills?
You know you want some more girl, so come on, yeah
Can I get more thrills?
You know you want some more girl, so come on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Come on baby, let's get blown, mm
Now you can fly the friendly skies
With the S-N double O-P, D-O double G-Y
Now don't ask why
Just keep looking good in the hood, damn girl, you so fly
We could do what you want to
You say you drink Alize, or was is Malibu?
It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a ho
She kept telling me, ""Doggy Dogg, I gotta go""
So I let her get in the wind and co-macked her friend
Two plus two, it equals four
This is some shit that could last forever more
I'm tryna put my bid in
Naw I'm just kidding, come on ma, get in
And don't ask where we going, pimping and hoeing
Drink pouring and weed blowing, you know it, come on!

[Chorus: Vanessa Marquez & Pharrell]
Can I get more thrills?
You know you want some more girl, so come on, yeah

You know you want some more girl, so come on

Come here baby, lemme holla at you real quick
I've been looking at you, from the corner of my eyes
Checking out your hips, lips, tips and your thighs
I've been wanting to do you, for a mighty long time
You make a pimp wanna sing ""I-I-I""

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
We'll head to the hills, your dreams I'll fulfill
We could do it how you want cause I'm oh so real
Tell me you, naw I won't squeal
You wit Da Big Boss Dogg so seal the deal
Pharrell got the Babyface
And Dogg got the Whip Appeal, so name the place
This love I bring to you, on the real baby girl
Won't you do me a favor and sing for Snoop?

People gripping they heat just to settle they beefs

You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased
We need peace, not brrr in the streets
The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps
Every time I spit they get weak
Knowledge reigns suprrreme
I take you back to the days when the telephone used to rrring
I'm reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!

Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in

No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back

Ain't no good, it's all badluck, shucks, shoppin' poppin'

Grab a honey, take her to the floor and do it just like this
(You can do it, you can do it just just like this)
You don't have to break it down to the floor (c'mon, yeah)
All you gotta do is keep movin your hands like this
(Like this, you do can do it, you can do it too)
Like this (c'mon, you can do it, you can do it too)
I feel playa when I move and dancin to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on like this

[Damani]
I throw my hands like Marvin
Sorta like James Brown how I +Get Down+
I'm holdin my chain so it don't swang
I'm slidin my feet, stayin on the beat
I dip low then bring it back slow
If you didn't wanna dance, why you on the flo'?

[Bad Lucc]
Damani's on the go and Mr. Lucc on the catch-up
Soopa Doopa behind, and baby this a set-up
Two-step with me - call your girls
I got two ref's with me, they call the game quickly
Big boy smooth, I'm too cool for the runway
Playa of the year, my gear's set for Sunday

[Soopafly]
Wait right here girl I'm comin back Monday
Slide right in front of me; get our dance on
Fred Astaire, Faye Dunaway; eyes on us
While we move to the clap; I'm nice with the dance
And I'm smooth with the rap; we in the zone with the lights and glamour
Glass full of Patron, the code is grammar

[Damani]
Coat made of panther, excuse me miss
Let me show you how to do it

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Let me holla at you baby, come close, it's
Bigg Snoop Dogg, king of the coast, bitch
Walk with me, stay focused
Put it on me little mama, let me see you stroke this
It seems like, the mo' hits
On a slow drift, bubble like a fo'-fifth
And everybody everybody notice
So to cool cool Calvin Broadus
And every woman is a goddess
And every rapper is a artist
Yeah right, you're dead wrong, just sing along
It's Godzilla for reala my nigga, King Kong
Givin' niggas the blues
As I'm walkin' on these fools in my blue suede tennis shoes
I'm two-steppin' with my weapon close
On the dance flo' loc, cause you never know
Yeah baby girl, she's strapped, but she cool
Cause we ain't come, to act no motherfuckin fool
We just chillin like a villain, got my hands to the ceilin
And I'm feelin the feelin, come feelin like this

[Chorus]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Check it out
I-I know baby girl I know
See, out here in the West
Nah, we don't do that

Do it just like this, c'mon

"[Intro]
Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

[Verse 1]
Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
For all my doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day

I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a strech, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said ""Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?""
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard!""
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, ""oh no""
I went back in, ""I forgot my Indo!""
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard-to-get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" cause she looked upset
She said um:

[Nancy Fletcher]
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me

[Verse 2]
Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!""
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, ""What was goin on?""
I tried to break it up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""
She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying

""Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay""

And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born!
I said ""Cheer up!"" and I gave her a hit
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""
She said, ""No you're not!"" then she starts cryin
I says I'm 19, she says, ""Stop lyin!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

How backwards that is

A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin somethin on the side? It didn't make sense

(Soopafly)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, cause we gon' make it through

I told that nigga like Chris Tucker
""Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'""
We was makin chemistry, but who is he?
And how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?

Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
Got me losin my mind
Well if lovin you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that ""This was the way love was meant to be""
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

Nike Cortez on my feet in a deep sleep with a freak
From the meet and greet, now it's left to me
Rick bounced the beat, gave a ounce to P
Had to cut the bitch off for popping off to me
I'm back to business relentlessly, I ain't done 'til I'm finished
Variety in your society and bitch, I'm the menace
You wish I would call back, you wish I would fall back
See, I'm a dope boy, so I'm a need my football back
In and out these routes like I was Julian Edelman
I needs all mine from the shit I been peddling
I'm settling for nothing less than the top notch
Jumping over all you hoes like hopscotch
Bitch, back up off me and leave me alone
I'm walking my dog a half a mile from my home
On my phone, tryna get rich, talking shit to a bitch
Coming up with some shit like this

Yeah, holla at me
No, I'ma text you from my other number
Yeah, it's the 818
Oh, you want me to hit you from the 213?
We find our hero, Blaps Bastardly, roaming the land
With nothing but his MPC and his moral compass in hand
Avoiding all punk shit, not needing two dollars in his hand
Weaving through the malevolent man and malevolent plan
You got to catch him

"[Verse 1]
Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump?
And who got the thump that makes ya cum?
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in
I got the motion, the potion
And once Priest hit the groove everything is in motion
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around
And all of my homies on lock down, or either underground
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin?
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know
Who started with me, who departed with me
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's
Regardless, let's see with bifocals, don't try the locals
And y'all wonder why they despise my vocals
I Fold you like crystals, rap spittin like clips do
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

[Verse 2]
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder
Man dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney
Or Bogey for Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homie, and I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin three words up in lightning
As long as I'm bouncin with this I know you likin this
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my photo
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey fo-do
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car
The Double R from the dirt to the stars

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

[Verse 3]
Well in verse three, the worst see?
After part two, know when I start the clock there be a heart, too
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do
I thought you knew we bust
I demolish, stay polished, got no time to rust
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luther
Cause ya see ain't no loser
That can get the scoop on the Super Duper Snooper
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers
You know I kizick the bomb digga-dee, bomb-ba-zee
They can't get with the D-O double G
You know MC slash master of ceremonies
Runnin thangs, pullin strings call me Snoop Pesci
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me
Don't wanna test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I?",Snoop Dogg,May I,

(Snoop Dogg)
I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner
My nigga Spanky-Loc was playin basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, 'bout to squab my Doggz
Dirty Red gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble, fight cos that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uhh
And ain't no need to reach for heat cos you can't get your blast on
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em
And when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
Cuz if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
Cuzz I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
Man this bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just....

(Chorus)
Me & my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em)
(Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz

(Snoop Dogg)
Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko cos he go taken my swim
I think cos my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's cos he lost his big homey Don Killer see
Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-Dead
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit

(Chorus)
(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard",Snoop Dogg,Me and My Doggs,
"[Chorus]
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Nate Dogg]
But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]
[2 Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

[Chorus]
(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash
(Me and my homies)
There's no need to ask
(Me and my homies)
We are still the best

Troubles plots on thee mind

Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm makin' things happen fast
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
Face lookin' stupid, broke, startin' feelin' dumb
I'm young but I'm a grown man
Takin' thangs into my own hands, I'm tryin' to own land
But life a twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this
It seems on but its off, I keep missin' this shit
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on, but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life whats left is death
Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn, its still death after life
And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G
But, these problems probably havin' niggas prayin' to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my shit tight, ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg, just to live on your knees
And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity, God help me please

Puttin' the serve down for cabbage, just to keep the cluckers buzzed
Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin' about a jack move, tryin' to whoo-ride
Gettin' jealous cuz my niggas got this rap game sold up
Them niggas wanna trip, (brrr-brat-dat) they got blown up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play a muthafucka out for his knot
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
Don't be fuckin' wit my niggas on the midnight shift, Shit (shit)
He kept, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known, for servin' more than an oz. so
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin' chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin' for them niggas from the night before

Now its all about the dollars, Impalas that bounce
Havin' cars and bitches, havin' a proper amount
Quarter million chillin'
Robbin banks and many mo'
Some life and darkness
We all get it started, coldhearted
Get around, my life won't change for the good
It seems soon I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me?
Ayo Daz, you da soldier would you die for me?
The hood tradition's got a lot of niggas killed for dumb shit
The OG's think they run shit, the youngsters control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Be siding with the drama when the dogg fight, street fight
And a lot a mob puttin' on mo
Problems get solved, but revolved with ammo and a fo-fo
But sure I did the record blast five times
254 sentence to jail time

"[Intro: German Woman]
Guten tag, Ich liebe diesen Tag
Ich can't find on this sing
Oh mein Gott, ich glaube Conan, sign con me
Ich swear to God, dizzy unbusted

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know my story
I did a lot of balling
Been around the world
A lot of girls calling
A lot of panties falling
Out the air and on the stage
If my life was a book
You wouldn't miss a page
But none of that really matters
When I cut my eyes and roll
Seen her pass by
I damn near dropped my folds
I'm like Snoopy breathe
Kush had me gone
I couldn't think straight
Pimpin' was all alone
Shoulda seen her walking
Like a model do
If this was Twitter
I would follow you
Open your world to new things
Let Doggy take your hand
I'm seeing wedding rings
Call Diddy lets make a band
She got me hot
I don't want to leave
I seen the world's best
But she's something to see
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I couldn't catch her name
I call her Miss Everything

[Hook]
Tell me have you seen her (Seen her)
Five something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes
Small little waist
When the floor goes tremble
Make a grown man cry
Oooh
I keep runnin' the tune at her
But the numbers never got exchanged
Every town, every city
Got a, a Miss Everything
Miss Everything (Miss everything)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know my story
I rocked a lot of crowds
Sold millions of records
I love my fans so loud
I got a thousand cars
And all hopes of bein'
A real superstar
I live super far
But none of that really matters
When I caught my eyes in Spain
She walked into me
Like you did your thing
In that Spanish accent
The one I love so much
She looked like an angel
One I wanted to touch
I blinked my eye for a second
And then she disappeared
When I see that Pretty Woman
I felt like Richard Gere
Boss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass
Unless we in they room, and they leave
And I watch that ass
But baby something else
Somehow I didn't speak
I been a player so long
Maybe I reached my peak
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I didn't catch her name
So I call her Miss Everything

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Yah, you know my story
I seen a lot of hoes
A lot of gold diggers
Luda call them pros
I don't call them back
And thats just how it goes
Most people call me Snoopy
Or S-N-double-O
But none of that really matters
When I was in New York
I had a show at The Garden
You know, poppin' corks
That's when I seen her
From a distance
She smiled and froze
Now everything I learned in the game
Told me she chose
And I don't miss a beat
This time I gotta speak
She looked magnificent
Like something to eat
Hey co, I can't let her go
I made my way through the crowd
Let's get out of here
Head to Filipe Childs
Lotta stars in place
Doggy set the mood
I'm like ""I like your style""
She's like ""I like yours too""
Before I hit this plane
I gotta know your name
She smiled as if she came
Call me Miss Everything

This shit is a maze, cuz singing like a Tempree
I disappear for one minute ‘til they miss me
Another TV show, more dough, I’m makin’ history
Now I’m back at your service
Wish me luck dear, I’m scared and I’m nervous
You never left you brought that hood back with ya
I’m the real deal, I ain’t got bullshit with ya
Another one I wanna make, another joint I wanna make
Open the oven put some candles on my cake
Twenty-five and countin’, etch my face into Kushmore Mountain
Can’t be scared of your opponent dog-gone it if you want it, trip this
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

La la la la la
I'ma get it like this nigga

[Verse 1: RedmanI'm]
Yo I got the green, Don Juan
I’m in the hood, blow the horn, bom-bom
This pimping ain't for free, here’s a coupon
My backwoods packs I turn to a futon
I got my eyes on seven figures
And I'ma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller’s
I’m shitting on 'em, I smell like a winner
Don't hit the bathroom for like 40/45 minutes
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And I’m a dog off the collar, the marijuana globetrotters
You got bud, I holler

[Verse 2: B-Real]
It's the four horsemen call reinforcements
We ain't looking for endorsements, we absorb your portions
We can roll the indo or sativa if you need to
Got a warehouse poppin' with the B she's a heater
Two on the lighter with tightest bitches, dancing getting higher
They all fire ladies never tire
Got her soul inspired now we flossing out
Sipping on some Hen 2.0, for your cotton mouth
This beat is banging like a Cali block in the 90s
Really fucking grimey and the po-po's right behind me
16's popping, smoke blowing out the window
When we roll up in the spot it's very simple

[Break: Method Man]
Uh, yeah, uh-uh
That's what you do

Big Snoop, Method Man, Redman, B-Real
Shout out to Wiz Khalifa and Sen Dog, you know! G-yeah!

[Verse 3: Method Man]
I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap
I'm cool, on the road to riches to get my G back
I'll bee dat! Killa Beez mind your beeswax
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at
Ask Big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
From the days of Cheech & Chong, to Willie Nelson
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it
A lot of y'all fucking with me, saying I'm on your bucket list
But I ain't the one to be fucking with
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe
Take three in a row
Aye lil nigga, gon hit that door
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters

[Verse 1]
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)

[Bridge]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 3]
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Let me get back on the highway, try my way

Never will I motherfuckin’ crash the wheel
Pass the feel, the tank with the drank in the cup
Look baby girl, thats whats up
Slide by my side bitch house in the cut
With my 9 by side when I side in the cut

You gonna stand outside or you gonna jump inside?
She said cool can my girls come?
We gon’ drank, smoke then fuck some

I love it when you put it in my back again
Fill up in your car then you back again

And try to put you up on game and try to show ya
That if you ain't black, you besta get a white lawyer
Cuz I'mma tell ya and give ya the game, that
Being black is like being in the yang
Cuz they always gone label you, always gone fable you
And always gone point at you when somethin go down
And I knew, that it would be me, and not jiz-ou
Cuz they know that I roll, with the biggest black criz-ew
And we all about gettin green
But when your black tryin to get green
It's hectic, know what I'm mean?
Cuz they always gonna, stop ya - drop ya - pop ya - mop ya
And then they gonna sweep ya, up under the rug
No more gangbangin, no more hidin out thug

You better watch out if your black

Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers
But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other -
Way, just play and say what you wanna say
Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
Cuz niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
Cuz I'mma tell ya, watch them niggas
Cuz them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care cuz they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin, they gettin you and gettin away
Its part of the pay, its part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all realated
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game peice from me to y'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

So Snoop Dogg speak the real
It don't even make a difference if it got matching sho'real

I want to tell you a story about a man that's been so good to me
And when telling this story
I hope it bless you
Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story

[Verse 1: James Wright]
Back when I was a little boy, you see
My life wasn't always perfect (perfect)
I remember my grandma praying
And she said one day it'll be worth it (worth it)
She said, ""Sit yourself down and listen to me
And let me tell you a little story
This story won't take to long
But I'ma tell you about his glory,""
She said

[Chorus: James Wright]
My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need

[Verse 2: James Wright]
I said it happened sixty years ago
When I was washed up in his blood
Saved my soul and he set me free
Now I'm praising the lord above
I never thought that I could change
Until he saved a wretch like me
Now I'm here to tell the story
So that that you will be set free!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Well once upon a time in the Church of God
There was sinners and saints
Evens to odds
Do's and don'ts
Wills and won'ts
The haves to the have-nots
Will be sittin' up front
Gettin' the sermon up close
[?] the reverend [?] the offerings
We live in a benevolent lifetime, so stay right
I'm preachin' 'em teachin' 'em givin' em more than a look
My granny raised me right about the Good Book

[Chorus: James Wright]
I said, My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need
My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!

And led you upstairs to a room with 37 niggas
That was strapped up hatin', waitin' on you

Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
""No Limit Top Dogg"", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
""Last Meal"" was the one that took me off the leash

And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow you
And I think of all the days my hope was through
And still you came and brought me through

[Verse 2]
Brought me through from shame, temptation
Hopelessness, no motivation
Accusers in the waves throwing dirt on my name (yeah)
What's my name without Your love?
(What's my name without You?)
Will not make it without Your love
(I won't make it)

[Pre-Chorus]
God, send a new wave
Do a new thing (yeah)
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things
So we wait...on You (yes!)

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

[Bridge]
I can't be without Your love
I can't be without You
I can't do it, no
Won't you help me say it
I can't be without Your love
I can't be without Ya
I can't, I can't alone

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

So, send a new wave
Do a new thing
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things, yes
We wait on You!

Please move
Please move
Please do things
I know You can
I know

[Rap verse]
Came back for Him, the body was gone
All that was left was the stone
The Sword it was on
Two feet, on two wings
Blood and meat from the bone
A risen kingdom, but no mobile phones
Just faithful messengers
Everyday is being used in mysterious ways
And everything is a cost with some pain
Some lonely days, Jehovah knows
High on the throne, Christ to the right
This pen can't write the sights of my home
In spite of miracles, doubt abounds
Octo-, with tentacles
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

[*slows down*]
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown",Snoop Dogg,New Wave,Mali Music

New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

Verse One: Kurupt
It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me like Niece, to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherf**kers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confuscius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherf**k your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherf**ker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin
Give a F**K, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherf**ker don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply
Layin hoes lifes empty, the invicible MC

Chorus One

Chorus Two: Snoop
Too much, I serve too many people, too much
It's too much, I serve too many people
And when I finish servin ain't gon be no sequel

Chorus One and Two

Verse Two: Kurupt
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
So how the f**k you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existance
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin
The highest in intellect, try connectin with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherf**ker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally
Bore your whole molecular, structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix
Hittin MC's like picks the deadliest lyricist

Chorus One and Two: repeat 2X
[Kurupt]
We live... tonight I serve two thousand MC's
We live... cause can't none f**k with the DPG'z
[Daz]
We live (baby) because tonight I serve two thousand MC's
We live (baby) none can f**k with the DPG'z

Verse Three: Kurupt
Eryday, I bust rhymes and recite
In ways that make MC's stop in daylight
I'm the deadlies MC you wanna see on the streets
Invincibility is what makes me complete, compete
Nah you can't even fade me

I've traveled the world
Seen a lot of things
Seen a lot of sunshine
Been through a lot of pain, Lord (so much pain)
I tried to depend on my friends
To help me make it through
But at the end of the day, Lord
I found out there is no one else like You, Lord

There is no one else like You

You're the Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end
Before anyone else
You're my closest friend
When times got hard
He was always there for me
When Satan thought he had me bound
You were there to set me free
Yes, you were, Lord

Searched high and low
I gotta take you wherever I go

As long as You right next to me

And hold onto what i have can you dig that?
And what i do, i do for the benefit of me and my kids
Dig that

Im so glad ive got my own
So glad that i can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me

Its something kind of funny
How the man take your money
Be sure as he can be
Its such a way you'll never see
Its a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
What we can't turn to dope
And put all aside the hope

Chorus (x2)

Twinkling tinkling braids

We do all sorts of things
While you're in a modest place
Your conciouses only peace

Yeah i had to make peace with myself you know what i mean
I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years
So i told myself i wanna know what it feels like to be high fo life
And i mean man i tell ya it feels real good
You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother im telling you its a great feeling
Can you dig that
I can dig it

More and more you grieve
(sing that song nephew)
Until you grow another need
You claim this fantasy
You'll have no reality

He who fears fate lives like coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
Then you get to poppin you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas wit spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snicth, and the heart of dead nark
Niggas never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold , then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; rock-a-bye baby
My bitch will do it to you with a lil 380 (yea)

Out on the scout I'm about my papers
Cause ain't nobody doin Dee no favors
I'm trying to get major with minor risk
Maximising the minimum of time is spent
On the heist, nice and easy believe me
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy
Keepin niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm booking em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline cos I got a Tec-9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low
I go up in ya like a skeleton

I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with
The bare hand man sleeper
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the peepa
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time
So try me you're liable to lose on my line

"[Intro]
Top of the morning, there's just something I wanted to address real quick. You know, there's a lot of people that didn't, like, really appreciate the Unity Walk yesterday. Don't like peace and all that, and I understand. When I was out there, I didn't understand it either. They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, ""Nigga, that's schoolyard."" You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s. You go two steps this way, you got Bloods. We wait for each when we walk to trial, bro. We united in here. Nigga might not hang with a nigga every day, but we know we got each other's backs. And I don't knock y'all out there that ain't with the peace, but don't get on people that are. Some people's just tired of this shit, bro.

[Chorus]
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

[Verse 1]
For God so loved the world he gave us a good Crip
The late, great Neighborhood Nip
Dippin' in this L.A. bullshit
'Bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (Yup)
Wasn't nothin' like these thug phonies
Was always showin' love and big respect for all the Blood homies (What up)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see your team ridin' rich
You see that envy and that pride, that's that green-eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (Damn)
It had been better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

[Chorus]
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

[Verse 2]
All it take is one, one, one brave Blood and one brave Crip
Standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
Out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
Steady hearing ""Jesus saves"" out of devils lips
Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
Hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
But here we go again, underneath the gun
They got us thinkin' we all different when we (One)
So I'm givin' thanks to the gangstas, givin' praise to the neighbors
Damus and Pirus, y'all got the whole world amazed
Special shout out to the Hoovers for showin us how it's done
Ain't nothin' greater than when we unite as (One)
Ain't got no ulterior motives and no other agendas
Fakin' like you with us just like some puppet pretenders
We ready to end this
For every eye that still cries
It's time to realize God will rise when we tie us

[Chorus]
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

[Outro]
One Blood, one cuz, yeah
One Blood, one cuz
Now put them all together, you have one, one, one
One Blood, one cuz
Motherhood, brotherhood, ain't no other hood
Just imagine if we all was one hood
Now put them all together, you got one",Snoop Dogg,"One Blood, One Cuzz",DJ Battlecat

Now you've been waitin, patient
Dinner dating, classic chasing
Your homies hating 'cause you're never around
You're either at the movies or you're out shopping around
All that for the cat, it's a wrap
You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that
If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder

Be her father, be a man, be the man
That made her never wanna see another man
Make it better than good, make it great
Make her visit, then make her stay

Yeah man, if you got a real one
You better hold on to her
See 'cause a real man will come along the way
And smooth knock her...

[Verse 2]
If you like her, wife her
If you love her, smother her
With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way
And pull that ring out on the same day
A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage
You gon' lose her if you scared of marriage
A real boss got a foundation
You need somebody in your life with patience
Minus the hate... Shante, what more can I say?
But baby look at us today
Your husband's a boss, the kids is cute
King of the Coast for the gang of loot

You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line

I'ma make it good for you, make it hood for you
Make it do what he couldn't do for you
Tha Doggfather supreme, jump in the shower
I appear through the steam
Braids and all, over six foot tall
Can't no other brother fade the Dogg
I'm all ya need, I'm who ya want
I'm here to coach ya through your do's and don'ts and he won't
I got the remedy, the energy

You see performing for thousands of people
Filling their hearts with love and joy
Not knowing that I'm going through so much pain
But God knows...everything!
And I mean everything that I'm going through

Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain

[Verse 1]
Feeling so alone...and deserted
People standing all around you
You walk around (hey)
With a fake smile on your face
Cuz you don't nobody to know what you're going through (nooo)
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the....morning
But you weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming (ohhhh)

God knows about your pain (Ohhhh)

Feeling so alone...and deserted
People stand all around you
Walk around
Head up with foolish pride
Cuz you don't want nobody to know what you're going through (ohhhh)
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the....morning
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy comes in the morning!

Comes in the morning

In the world of change, here I am
Tryin to have some thangs
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper

[Snoop Dogg]
Thinkin of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full {*echoes*}

Won't let no bitch niggas close to me
From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm
Cause I'm a muthafucking shining star, you feel me

Quick draw - I'm fast on my heat
Buckle up and take a ride in my passenger seat
Put your feet to the pavement, look at my behavement
See how, the be how, and trip what I was raised with
Can't no nigga fade me, bangin' like the 80s
Had a lot of money with a handful of babies
Boy, this shit is crazy - straight from the turf
Hit the red alert and ask Mack it better work
So I slide to the spizot, right behind the lizide
And get a bag of pizot, avoid getting hizocked
Cause hizabs is on me, they want me, but I can't fold
I'm an Eastside rider, I was born to roll
Never tell to be told, never sell to be sold
On the level, what a rebel, boy, I stay in control
And I'mma let you ride with me so you can see how it goes
And we'll hit the track and let you peep out some hoes
And if you like what you see, and you agree with me
Then you enjoy my perspective of the LBC
Kick back and roll up, and mix the Henny with the soda
We ridin' like we flyin' through the system of solar
And the aroma of doja, the atmospherin' we hearin'
Since I'm the driver I'm ridin' with rear-end super suspension
The misson can't be completed 'til you get that vibe
Now you're mobbin' to the beat on the passenger side

Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow

We in the tre, so I'mma dip it slow
Next stop is the liquor store
Last sip, pour it back
So good, I had to get some more of that
Yeah. And now we on tizilt
Interior, mizilk - exterior, sizilk
Okay, okay, alright - say it like all day
In the tre with the dawgs, that's the player life
How you feel now?
I know - you probably want the wheel now
But I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank
And pour some more of that drank
And hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock
Live in the drop
You can hear it when we comin', we speedin' up the block
While we're beatin' up the block, it's 'bout to go down

Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized by The Neptunes sound
My peoples always see me and they think I'm on point
So they roll me a blunt, or either pass me a joint
I'm the modern day Rick James, yeah that's me
Anything less than the best is blasphemy
So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!
I took another hit and then my vision got blurry
I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry
I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri
Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!

Nick nack patty wack, give a Dogg a bone
Naw don't gimme nothing but a handful of stones
Don't stop! I ain't finised yet
You say you got the bomb? You wanna make a bet? it's on!
I blew about three zones then took baby home
Nigga what?! Motherfucker I'm grown
I have it how I want it, did it done it and stunted
Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth
Slow down! ho damn! you're doing too much
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!

Yeah this is classic, fantastic, I'm blasted
I've been growing and blowing, niggas wonder how I lasted
Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights
I got it all mastered
Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded
We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out

The West got the best, the East got the peace
I'm out and about with a blunt in my mouth, peace!

Charge it to the game, man it's a cold game
But somebody gotta do it, that's real for shes'a
It ain't easy, pimpin' to me is four girls on your team
Down to scheme, aim to beam, for that cream
Cross country track, greyhound buss ride
Down to get your muthafuckin' fetti on, you hear me though
There ain't no limit to what she does
On the really, on to Philly, lemme get a ride on cus
Ghetto love, and every thug need a little
All I want is the money, motherfuck the middle
No backbone is back on to get yah
Unless you got a down ass sister to twist her, can't twist yah

Uugh, yeah

Pop bottles (pop bottles)
Shake hands (shake hands)

I try to tell 'em but they won't understand that pimping ain't easy
I got money (got money)
I got cars (got cars)
Still fucking with them hood superstars (superstars)
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar like pimping ain't easy

[Snoop Dogg]
Well it ain't
All them faces in that laker paint
Casa by the lake
Make a little nigga faint
Balling is what I does
I ain't messing with you can'ts
I'm a can do negro
A real life California hero
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account
Nigga ain't ya mad at me
I'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine
Yeah you see it fool
Snoop's everywhere, Italy I'm heavy there
Did a show in Rome like ho say you ain't never there
Talking 'bout you popping bottles
I don't see none
You made it rain where?
I don't see a wand
Go on get it off
That's what they like to hear
It's your money pimp
We don't fight it here
It's hard enough to be me
Not trying to be you is someting I got to see
Until then I'mma

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
This ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you
I been through some shit
I made it easy for ya
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies
Tell 'em what she want to hear
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here
And Snoopy is your homie
Nah nah girl he out of here
Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here
You a fool Jack
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch
Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool
I pop cause I'm the man
Now watch me and Kells

[Hook]

[R. Kelly]
I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag
Pimping in my cup
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause thats how I does
Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

[Snoop Dogg]
A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Heron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't ""Pull My Ho Card""
.. I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
.. I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for ""1-8-7 on a cop""
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

[Hook 1: repeat 2X]
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (gon' get pimp slapped)

[Hook 2: repeat 2X]
Money, I get it, paper I got it
I got the dope
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up

[Snoop Dogg]
If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worse than them devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But I'ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (shshshsh)
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up (what's up)
He better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Do Double in the hood again (Eastside)
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (feel it)

There once was a kid by the name of Dave
Who stayed in the mix and never ever obeyed
He paid no attention to the shit that was taught to him
Always stay strapped for the shit that was brought to him
This nigga was a motherfuckin’ fool
Only 13, fuckin’ bitches in high school
Laid back, his game was trump tight
He was chillin’ in the day time, clockin’ at night
Makes me wanna holla cause the dollar he kept
As he grows in his game, going step by step
To the status of an Al Capone, Mr. Big 6 in the game of bones
But you know what they say. What goes up must come down
So just peep what I speak as you focus to the sound

[Hook 1]
A little bitty nigga by the name of Dave
Who was known through the hood cuz he misbehaved
But when the cavi got plucked it was time to get paid
Sack his shit out in dumps, now he’s on his way

[Verse 2]
Mischievous and devious, that’s how his life was
Puttin' they swerve down a cavi just to keep the pluck of bud
Some of the money making motherfuckers from the other side
Was thinking ‘bout a jack move tryna hoo ride
Gettin' jealous cuz my nigga got the dope game sewn up
Them niggas tried to trip, biddy biddy back, they got blown up
Blown up a lot, you could still get shot
You don't never play a motherfucker out for his knot
Rule number 1 pay attention to the shit
Don't be fuckin’ with them little niggas, they ain’t to be fucked with
Kept getting it on to the break of dawn
Now he’s known for serving more than I own
He’s got a 187 on his motherfuckin’ chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
Lookin’ for the niggas from the night before
So he can blast they ass but he don’t know they at his back door

[Hook 2]
Dave on a mission out to set trip
But one of his homies is a motherfuckin’ snitch
Some nigga named Mick from around the way
They said we’ll give you 20 G’s if you show us where he stay

[Verse 3]
A dude named Dave caught up in the drive by
Tears from his mother, watchin’ her son die
Set trippin, somebody slippin’, bullets zippin’
Dave gone for good, now his moms is flippin’
No need for crying nor dying Dave is dead
Point blank, he took a 9 slug to the head
Davey, the wannabe gangsta from the hood
He wasn’t that bad and he wasn’t that good
All he understood was get crazy blitz
So he bought some of that to get some of this
This got him back but that went to them
Them being they who made his head lay
He didn’t obey he said he made this cash
Crash from the gun, Dave lies in ash
Smash, it hits the front page quick

Watch your mouth never speak on what you not know
I'm from the west coast I turn his face into a pothole
15 deep niggas creepin' in the Tahoe
Let's see you act macho when I pull the burner on ya
Sideways like a taco
Rap niggas weak, all talk like a Raldo
Trunk full of cargo
Dry like Barstow
Arsenal run up on 'em
Get up on 'em
Drill 'em with the clips
Niggas gon' respect mine
I run this whole shit
Crip rag in my pocket
Three eighty on my hip
But back to this hip hop
Who next on the list
Gangstas don't kiss we get old and die rich
I smoke till I'm sleep
Crush these niggas with my fist
Your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch
So back to the Glock with the infra-blue clip
We hit licks and gang bang
You on some T-Pain shit
Chop the pop and 20 crip
Watch the flames hit his whip
Then I'm back to the block shit
Rock shit, hot shit
Hit 'em in the chest
Doggy run up in his pockets
Misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket
I sat back and let you little niggas make your profits
Nonsense, I'm watching, hoes out of pocket
You heard what they say
Don't block it till you knock it
You stole my whole style
I'm 'bout to take you fools hostage

Nigga down South, huh?
I throw a bullet at ya who gon catch it nigga duck
Then send them goons at ya

They wanna be Daz
They wanna be Kurupt

We posted Boo - you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

[Eve]
Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hop on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'mma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

With the 'K though, like the spray though
Sculpted left hand full of clay dough
Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato
Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine
We loot 'til the boot out

Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days

Keep everything splendid, that's how I intended
Class is in session, you might get suspended (shhhh)
If you don't shut the fuck up and listen for a minute

Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggas out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggas can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Hook] - X 2
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here

This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggas just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggas come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here

It's 12.30 AM, Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog [head up up] in my cup
[Put Rudolph and Moses] lil' bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}
Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}
Life is so crucial and cold, [it's worse] for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh
Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it ...

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me

[Verse 2: Bad A$$]
Back then, you woke up to the sound of ""I Saw Mama Kissing Santa""
Made you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shouted
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs

Christmas Eve, I believe, '76 was the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed; I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and Mom's private secret

Big ass booty with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?""

You tell me ""don't rush""
Money stashin, you got me sneakin
And we all alone in the zone, I be tweakin
I almost got caught, my game is leaking
I had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend
It's written on my face, and I can't even hide it
So I decided, to ride it
Roses are red, and Violets are blue
Girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do whatcha do when ya do
And now ya want a Benz for ya birthday
And I been waitin to hit that ass since the first day
I'm buyin you gifts, draping you out, with gold

Because my life is my wife, and that ain't right
Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, and what I was choose to do

So sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party
Ain't no party like a DP party
Cos everybody in the DP party's naughty
They acts a fool, old school, new school
Everything is everything, everybody playin' cool
Ain't no set trippin', everybody just dippin'
Bitches gettin' with niggas and niggas gettin' bitches
It's all superb, word to my momma
Ain't no drama, no need for that
You can put your gat back in' your pocket
Unlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it
Don't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)

[Chorus]
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on

Slow down
Slow your role, junior
Slow down
Slow your role, junior

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it
With rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap
And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true and slow down

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 2: Mia X]
Ayyo Snoop, I used to kick up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by
I never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age but they call me mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed
And then I, dropped to my knees and called on the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild?
Damn I had to slow down

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 3: Mia X]
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records
For my come up from sun up to sun down
I'm trying to get my money
Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Everybody seemed glad but now they mad
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun
I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in the mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't, never ever, talk no shit
Unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters
Slow down I can't take the heat

Smoking smoking weed

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
Rinse my mouth out, now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough
You're with the big boss Dogg so go and puff puff
Real talk, can you still walk?
Have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
See that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
Smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat before you fall out
I'm a ball out and everyday, we're going to smoke until we all out
And that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J, he knows what time it was
(Smoking, smoking weed)

"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, in the L.B.C
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!""
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit""
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down
Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

[Verse 2]
Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

[Verse 3]
I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, ""Hello! Hi!""
Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!""
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

[Verse 4]
I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin, ""Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!""
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry...

I'm international money maker, player hater
Shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake

Zip you up and roll

And try to get around wit us, and hang around wit us, and clown wit us
Hold on, this shit here is for the establishment
Niggas that's havin' shit, and if you ain't roll on and stroll on

In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds
You all can't believe what we did
Provide an opportunity in the community
Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me

They love me, that's understood
And we burn trees that's so good, damn, we, should
Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my 'gars
Burn, then I pick up my two dogs and bend the curb
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh {?} bud
Now I bend it up like a thug
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know

Peep that out

"[Intro]
I would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed.
Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
Ours was not filmed.

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, let's move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not
(Get up, stand up) Facts half backwards and inaccurate
(Stand up for your rights) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up
(Get up, stand up) Good over evil, deceitful
(Don't give up the fight) Morals, principles, it's simple, son

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Slick Rick]
What will it take for my peoples to connect together?
You know it's black excellence if we compete together
Picture a photograph of black folks lit together
In high definition, in high, I would never
Turn my back on the block, I got the block on my back
Like James Brown, boy, I'm proud to be black
To all my sisters, Mother Earth has birthed us
Lurchers, it hurts us first, less heard this
To all my sisters, ain't no knockin' you back
Politicans politickin' with a gown and a cap
The house got flavor and I like it like that
Black girl power, yeah, I'm rockin' with that
Doors is gettin' kicked down, statues is gettin' ripped down
Presidents meetin' overseas just to have a sitdown

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

So what are you saying?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
The foundation was laid, y'all nation was made
Off our ancestors' back, back, back in the day
Four hundred years ago, y'all made us slaves
And you can hear it in the spirit comin' deep from the graves
Life is a maze
Smoke so much dope you in a daze
But you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
Who do you praise? But anyways
I read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg
So I read the Bible, then the holy Quran
Went to Jamaica to acquire my knowledge
Sat with some Rastas 'til my game got polished
The gangbang extreme with malice
Trees and degrees like I'm trained for college

They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

I play some D and pop a three and fly up in the air again
First-round draft pick came in with this rap shit
Get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch
Those were the rules, I aimed for the full pie
Took a slice and now I'm popping at the bull's eye
I'm equivalent to excellence
With my weaponry, I'm stepping while I'm rapping it
Now could I should I would I do things your way
And end up dead or in jail? My nigga no way
It's like some good hot head with no foreplay
I won't be caught so I cut you like I'm OJ

But my nigga Black did give me that Gucci belt (black)
This where I put my heat I never leave it on the shelf (strapped)
My heart froze I don't ever leave it on my sleeves (nah)
I got hoes I ain't never met a bitch I need
So when she tell me that she leaving i'm a let her leave
My aroma in her room ain't gon' let her breathe
Got it smelling like some money and a couple g's

And all some niggas ever did was fuck up the count
And all some niggas ever did was run they fucking mouth
Had to keep it moving had to keep my head up
Had to re-up and recoup to get my bread up
Had to take a nigga boo and put her legs up
Her nigga probably do the same with my main thing
Still ride with the flag for the gang gang
I'm a real trap nigga, I don't gang bang
I done been across the map with the propane
They'll point a nigga out get your old man
Put the noodle in her mouth like the low mein
Kill a nigga with a strap like a gay bitch
Made a band in a minute off 8 sips
Tried to walk away from trapping but I can't quit

Pop a bottle of wine
Then at 10 hit the club

You better check him, tell him I'm off the chain
I buck and bang, homie that's on the gang
Oh I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' stacks
You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that
I've been around the world, check grip in every state
Yo' bitch don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate
But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have yo' bitch make my bed
My pockets fat as shit, you niggas mad as shit
Pumps ""Neither One of Us"", I'm on some Gladys shit
Many have tried and failed, shit I'm out on bail
I make more cheese than your old man and he went to Yale
Shit I went to jail, you can go to hell
You got some shit to tell? I got some shit for sale

Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change
And I don't want the Range, chop that trey on thangs
That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks
I'm on some player shit, dynasty, straight Laker shit
Cook it up on some baker shit and chop it up for some paper bitch
I got my mind right, and my money right
If you ain't in the game for the money you the funny type
And I'm laughin' my ass off, Phantom with the mask off

Your bitch you 'bout to lose, cause she about to choose
And that's the way it goes, S-N double-One
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ho
Now go get paper girl, yeah I meant for real
One time I told a bitch not to come back 'til she got $2,000 in $2 bills
That's cold game, the whole thang
I'm high as Soul Plane, I smoked the whole thang
You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it
I take a cocaine Buick and put some blue to it
That's some gangsta shit, these hoes love this gangsta dick
Khakis and some gangsta kicks, yeah bitch that's my gangsta fit

Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rock-a-bye beddy-bye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldn't find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And I'm still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
It's not that I'm dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said, ""Snoopy, don't you ever cut your hair""
I was dazed and amazed
That's why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school, I used to get cool grades
When I graduated, used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack, just like them vatos
Posted up six-one, yeah, that's the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped, though
Me and Geeda, Faith and Terry, that's when rump was enough
Can't forget Tim, Baby Dog and Half-Dead
Dre-Loc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along, I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood, checking my traps
As you get old, life like just might unfold
Can't settle, this might be untold
Twilight Zone, live life long
Smoke you a bone, and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo', and roll you a jay
And put it in the E-I
And let's stay way fucked up til we D-I
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air, repeat after me
I’m too blowed, forever in a day

Ain't nobody on the wall
Pop it, drop it, let that fall
Hey DJ, play my song
Step back, let it bang all night long
I need your attention, no hoping or wishing
Come in, in high-definition
Said I do, right that I do
Get up and get money, yep that I do

Bite it, roll it, light it

"[Intro: Sly Pyper]
Oh my God
If you’re good long enough you’ll know it won’t need to rain
With just one sunrise
My life, bumps & bruises
Battle scars had to prove my loyalty for my hood
These are better days
Voices from vices got me standing me here
Singing praises to Your name
For saving me from my yesterday
Second chances come with every sunrise

[Chorus]
I wake up feeling like the Most High's favorite child
Cuz he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Painted blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise

[Verse 1: Sly Pyper]
My life bumps and bruises
Tribulations and trials, but I made it through
So it’s all good
These are better days
I just want you to know
I’ve been to the bottom of the barrel of my pride
And I fell down by surprise
Why live in the dark when there's sunrise?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Shout it out to the world
IG posted it
If you get a second chance, you better make the most of it
I used to ride with the gun guys
Blaze to the fun times
But nowadays, I just praise until the sunrise
Been down so long
I’m used to falling, y’all
But I recognize, this my calling dawg
I been ordained, anointed with the oil
On the battlefield
Loyal to the soil
I'm lookin’ at the man in the mirror
See now things is gettin’ much clearer
I got my own church, my own choir, my own band
I guess you could say, I’m a brand new man
See rap guys usually don't get baptized
But how could you cleanse your sins without it
Make you wanna think about it, uh
Right reverend the reverend right recite light
You see today is the day to get your life right

So how the motherfucke you gonna pick your lips
To disrespect truth when I run with crips

So patch it if you want it, I suggest you post on it
Cuz when it's tured up fall back don't do me

Hopin' that you won't get caught
Never let em know about it
Only let em hear about it
Hit that paper, read about it

And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone

Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot

Call some hoes up, and get some cutty cutty
What's your life like? Mine's is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin', that china white
My people love me, the fans love me, I'm all go
If you ain't showin' love, then what you call for?
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife
Smoke 'til I'm gone, Dogg on the throne
I'm world-wide known, I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it 'cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plan, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin' on this gram

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I got my fam dawg, look at my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin'
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated
Steady wantin' freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holdin' the fam down, and my close homie
The peoples who were there, when some sucka left me lonely
Phony, when you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top baby, that's on me
Koch tryna claim that they made me
However you feel, another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need be
I'm in another zone, no place you could see, my nigga
Conyo to haters that don't know
Low pro, how a nigga like from costo
The one fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O, smokin', eatin' Cheerios

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's

It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king
And I'm still on the scene, you gotta love it
All out in public, the people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin'
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
With Madden on the screen, and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now, everybody on me
And on the blogs talk shit like they know me, hm
Aww fool, take you niggas to school
""How to get rich and stay cool""
Snoopy D O Dub, show you homie, even with the critics
And the Feds all on me, I was tappin' all the chonies
Dogg, but my folks call me Snoopy
Boss dogg, nigga sue me
Pony tail swangin' as I lay in the jacuzzi
Love of my life, while I'm puffin' on the oww wee, kush

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'

I don't say much

I never come off tacky, I'm a boss exactly
I'm like the slick suit Snooperfly Versace
Conversation flashy, y'all niggas can't match me
I talk to you slow, so your game can roll
Take advice from a player
Don't love her just play her
Boy I never could dare, to pay double the fare
Man I swear to God it's gon' be some trouble in here
Before I pay that bitch, I'm like a bossy hog
Half dog, half gorilla, bitch Donkey Kong
Niggas thirst for hoes, I got a thirst to ball
Tryin to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall
Fuckin with a-hundred-fifty, whole can of vodka
Mixed with gangbang, got a program like Poppa (hey hold up man)
I'mma do you a favor, let this pimpin save ya
Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her Ms. Behavior
Boy you move too fast, done too much talkin
I'm too much walkin to one who keep hoes hawkin
Don't fuck with Snoop too much cause he goes off when
Niggas mouth too much, so please no flossin
I step up quicker, cause the game don't pause
I gotta stay sucka free, cause it ain't no laws
Dig this y'all

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
That's the bidness mayne, step my game up up in this mayne
Long hours hard minutes mayne, with this hustle on splendid mayne

[Snoop Dogg]
Cause I'm a boss..
Yeah, real bossy like, and sometimes flossy
And if you fuckin with that
{""I-I know, I, I-I-know, I know you gonna dig this""}

I had to tell you the truth homey, but you got mad
Yeah I hurt yo' feelings, FUCK IT, it's too damn bad
I'm a major player, I got major game
I might floss a different bitch, but the pimpin the same
I ain't got time for no haters, I lay 'em flat on they back
I'm from the Dogg Pound homey, I don't fuck with them cats
I fuck with, niggas, who be bustin them shots
I'm talkin Long Beach, Inglewood, Compton, Watts
Close your chops, I knows your spots
Keep talkin nigga I'll expose your knots
You ain't ready for daddy, boy I do this for fun
It's like you versus Kobe ballin one on one
You ain't got no chance, you ain't got no fans
I kick the shit out you punk, look momma no hands
I'm not a, holy roller but I pray so hard
Help me, I'm sendin these bitch niggas straight to God
Shit I'm too damn grown, conversation is sho't
While your talk is funny, Jack I talk with money
Keep the chain on bling, the rock is sunny
For you smart mouthted bitches I ain't that dummy

We need to take it back to the way it used to be
You feel me?
Yeah, c'mon, yeah drift with me, drift with me, c'mon, drift with me y'all

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Take it back to the afros and the naturals
Cape cutter picks we slips into the back roads
I'm O.G. my nigga for real though
Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
I'm looking at the overview
Thinking bout '86 damn I was overdue
Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy
What up, oops a daisy
Demon or a heathen, scheming while I'm dreaming
Screaming to get even, seeing is believing
And don't you forget that
Get it to you get back hit that kick back
Three flies one a way
Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quit trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

[Verse 2]
I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight
Make it back to my ride
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
Slid me away just to get me away
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood
I'm banging riding but doing it good
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred
With the dealers the killers the realest
The best from the west and the beast from the east
Yeah I'm acting a fool
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school
I chose this life cause I knows this life
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight
I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
I can still hear my grandma's voice
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
Reminisce
It's all right

[Verse 3]
If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
And these was the rules squeeze on these fools
I came up in a different era homie
Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it
Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like
Now who you wanna be like Snoop
That fool on the TV screen
Or the homie on the corner getting major cream
In the Cadillac beating like Battlecat
A nigga with money don't know how to act
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts
All money nonsense yeah none of that
Quarter sack run it back
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back

Watch for the funny hat
Cause it's gonna come

"Yeah man...

""You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
But when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little
Light vacation""

[Snoop Dogg]
Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my
Peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...

It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decide to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggas ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

[Snoop Dogg]
Fuck that nigga, I'mma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, saying, ""Niggas can't stand me""
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, ""You know I get live-er when I get fluent""

Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'mma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, ""You blew it! You blew it!""
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first
You can never beat a ho, lemme show you how to treat a ho
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
(So...) Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggas who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggas a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggas is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt

And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit

All Star with the khaki suit

Into a zone where the whores on my dog bone

To L.A. - well that's great
We should sit down and talk face to face
You bring the barbeque, I got the paper plates
I can't lie girl, I like the way you shake
And when you dance the way you make your booty shake
Give or take, I rate you 'bout an eight
Or a nine - okay, fine, you a dime
And them other bitches they gon' wait in line
They hatin' on you how you take away they shine

Southern hospitality
Yea (This that south shit boy)
Y'all know how we do this (shit)
What up fool
This for all my boys in Mississippi
Magnolia, McConnell (fightin south you know)
This for all my boys in Tennessee (tell 'em)
Holler at ya boy when I get there (MJG and Eightball)
All my playas in Houston
Atlanta GA (Georgia boys, in the hou-)
(We'll say sup to that New Orleans clique out there)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a Sunday a fun day, one day
Away from Monday, and all day ain't no gunplay
And everything is alright outside (why)
Cuz Farrakhan done put his speech down and got all the brothers to ride
For one cause, and that's how it is y'all
Wise on up to rise on up dawg
Each one teach one, let the lesson be taught
It ain't my fault your homie Tommy Boy got caught
If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace
Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease

[Daz Dillinger]
When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him a gang of cars and money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he stayed
He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house

[Snoop Dogg (Daz)]
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Getcha money, size team (uh)
Getcha money man
(He was out to get paid)
Getcha money man (Poor Tommy)
Getcha money man (Me and Snoop on his team)
(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (Getcha money man)
Getcha money man (Getcha money man)

[Snoop Dogg]
Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him
They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away cuz he was just too fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash
Get it, get it, get it, cuz ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way ya gots to
Cuz this is somethin to rock to

[Daz]
Man, we stacked up dollars and Caddies
On missions muggin 'em for him
We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him
The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin shit
And never wantin to quit us, when the machine gun spit
Now we really deep in the game, now it's murder and drugs
No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be aquitted (young nigga)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy
Ridin on big ballers for a pasttime hobby
So if ya havin money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team
And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say ""spray em"", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG
Or find yourself layin six feet dizzy

[Daz (Snoop Dogg)]
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin paid
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
Me and Snoop still on his team, big pimps gettin paid
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
Check me out now man

[Daz]
We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share
A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it was off the hook ya'know
We had everything from Indo to blow (Whhaaatt, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin
So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin to say, to say, to say...

[Tommy talking]
Aye look here mayne
What some people won't do for money
Yea I had these two niggas that was on my team
Ya'know, down with me like the Grey Tape
It's always the niggas that's closest to ya
That be the ones that try to get'cha, ya'knowhaImsayin
Shit I heard these ladies the other day say that pimpin was dead
I said not in my bed bitch {*echo*}
Ah-ha, that's real, I'll put that on my fiz-sound

Do you think it is by accident that everytime
A black leader appears on the horizon
With any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down?
Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself
And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard

All right Dason
It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do
So detatched from us, these are only for you

(Snoop Dogg)
Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong
So cold should... gotta do wrong

(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
The world is filled with so much jealousy
You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot

(Snoop Dogg)
You might get got, and you might not
Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better
Watch your hand and watch how you play
Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted
If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'
I'mma give it to you - live and direct
Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check
They game every day but they try to find a way
But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh)
It's the same game, from my town to your town
From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right)
To the rebel we deliver the true game
And niggas gettin' upset cause they can't maintain (player haters)
Don't get mad cause I was blessed with a gift
To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right)
Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it
Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited
So come on down and party with the pound (come on)
You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down
Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers
Guranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper
Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in'
I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it
And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion
It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians
And the overseas g's, please
Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two)
I gots to do ya, like ya never been done
It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1
I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all
Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah
And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself
And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover
And if you dyin, you fuckin' with your death
I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf
I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement
And Death Row is still the label that pays me

(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
This world is filled with so much jealousy
I don't know who to trust cause
If I trust hey I might, end up shot (end up shot, hmm)

(Snoop Dogg)
I turn to the left and I turn to the right
I see some motherfuckers 'bout to have a fight (whassup, whasssup?)
What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?
Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the Glock?
I knocks on the door, plus ""Oh No""
I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo
Type of approach - I'm the team and the coach
I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'mma give you what you earned
And if you get it, watch me spit it
I'm commited to do it and I'm a still aquitted
Never ever did it, or forget it
This guranteed to keep the party hittin'
And I'mma give you people what you need
And I'mma smoke up on just like a bag of weed
And if you into the mixture and into the rapture
Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya
Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm)
I'm guranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right)
You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script
Guranteed to make the ho's go ahead and get whipped
And when they stop rockin' - they won't
But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha)
You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy)
Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled ""The Real McCoy""
I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed
I'm guranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up
I'm guarnteed to, do my thing
Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing
What'cha wanna do, what ya gots to
Cause this is somethin' to rock you

Just another day in the motherfucking neighborhood
A pimp's waking up and he's feeling good
Versace to the flow
He didn't even mess with the Taylor made shit today y'all
Smelling good with his reptiles on for sure

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm waking up in the morning, man I'm mourning; what's wrong?
My Nigga Corleone gone in my Zoning, but I'm boning, out to school
Cause I can't be late, cause they'll lock the gate
And it's damn near eight, that's when the bell ring
I'm a slide on in, and come right on in
And once I bail through the hallways, giving it up
Funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up
What up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong
Lunchtime, I make my way to get my grub on
Ten minutes to one, feeling good like I should for sure
Fourth period; walk through the door
I'm wreaking and smelling like endo
But still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class
By Warren G, the Twins and Daz
Nate Dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top Brouham
I hear some bitches from Wilson wanna tag.. along
And get up, for the get-down
Word got around about the niggas from the Piddound
We keep the whores on point, to join on lit
And keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off
Well we're all from the side, so we won't ask why
So you best get high!

[Chorus: X2]
Too high, so fly, like Snoop is poly high

[Verse 2: Wayniac]
See I... took advantage cause I live right next door
To the funkhouse, dunkhouse with the whole show
Niggas know how we go; from first 'til four we don't show
Lunch and then the last whore
It's getting dealt with some melt shit I guess
We smoke the Stress, cause my quest wasn't chronic yet
Little niggas growing up with my dogs
Cause we pack the hogs, exercise for my balls

[Verse 3: Trip Locc]
Stacked bigger than I thought it would be
Me and the family, working on TV, get paid and fuck their enemy
Moving on up, like the Jeffersons but quicker
All we think about is finding ways to get richer
Hit you like some dodo, got you're begging for more
It's a trip, I'm serving on the solo
Low blow, I had you feeling me
I got some C-O-N-V-O for your community

[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
I'm still in a fast lane state of mind
Time is impossible, for me to try to find
I'm out of school on the line
Hustling here and there, never show no fear
Hosted it up on a watch, I posted it up with a Glock
PCH in atlantic, is what you see just don't panic
It's me, Snoop rocks and when my homies get static
Got a pistol that blasts like a cannon
Look out for when we form at the wall, nigga where you standing?
Raise up, realize, street lights magnify
Life is giving; don't let it pass you by
I'm here and there with the bud, conversating with the drink
Shocked in my own zone, got time to think
Cause what would I be, if I wasn't who I am
Maybe dead or in jail, maybe time'll never tell
Approach me wrong and you will get chin checked
To disrespect my clique, and you will get dealt with
Uhh.. plain and simple, nevertheless with the best shit available
Test me now, let me see how brave you are
I'm scott free, so it's on like it used to be
D-O-G-G P-O-U-N-D G-C, for life, two times 'til I die
Oh why, Oh why, life is a challenge when you die?
What's the peak for me, is the cash and the strap
Since the 2-1-3 days been like that

[Outro: Big Pimpin]
Feeling very playish, ha.. I mean very plash
And the bitches saying: why shouldn't he?
Yeah he should; doing what he does and he does it good
He goes to work, yeah, he does it good
On pavement or dirt, checking the skirt
The story of a Pimp's Life, yeah baby
You gotta have the stomach for this shit, Hoo weeee
To fuck with this, the story of a Pimp's Life
Ohh yes baby, honey suckle to a berry

[Verse 2: Sylk E. Fine]
Now check me, I'm in a helluva situation
I got LOVE for the homegirl but it ain't no escapin
Now I've been waitin fo' the chance fo' me to do my thang
Cause when I GO OUT baby, I GO OUT with a bang! (bang bang)
Thursday night, 'bout to hang out at the House of Blues
Fresh attire, new shoes, plus a new, hairdo, WHOO!
I'm mesmerized by the music that they bump in the club
I see my homegirl man (whas' happenin, whas' up?)
Lookin like he need some love
And everytime I see him, he been givin me the eye
Cause he my type and I'm his type and plus we love to ride
Imagine that, off we left
Hot sweat hot sex it ain't like we just met (ahh, yeah, yeah)
Why she trust me? Since his girl went on a little trip
I made his sweat drip, he made me strip
It ain't my fault he in a fucked up relationship
That just go to show, you never know who you dealin with
Love over friendship, that's why I live my life trustless, yeah

[Chorus]
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much!
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much! Heyyy

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, I spent the night at the homie's house, shit
Slept in his livingroom, on his couch
Nigga high'n a motherfucker burnt out (shit)
Before you know it, god damn, the homie chirped out (damn!)
And he ain't said shit, he just dip in his Seville as he peel
Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?
Now baby got a gown on, gettin her clown on
As she slid downstairs, now she takin me down home
Cheatin in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
Am I wrong? Shit, on and on and on and on
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you
His baby momma in my face, she shakin poo-poo, what would you do?
Trust is a motherfuckin loco, shit
And so is temptation, and I don't know what I'mma do
Come on through (come on through) so I can cum on you (cum on you)
Shit if the homey knew (if the homey knew) if the homey knew
(if the homey knew)

Cause there was too many of ya'll to be left out

And some do the things that they do for crumbs

Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's foul
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin' ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But instead, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a check the next day, my homies say
This the way to get paid, DP's invade
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (Why?)
Trippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda rolled
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)

One move too many, nigga you missin'

Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D

Nah cuz, don't believe that - that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I mean with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game for the pulpit
And that's the bidness and God is my witness

I used to have a lot broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But would none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
Cause we all gonna get that day (For what?)
To see if our lives was straight
And see if we would be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs on some real talk homie
I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could I would fly to moon (zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms
I know

Now, as I think back to the words my grand daddy used to say

Yo girl on a mission tryna jack ol boy for the cash
Two ski masks, strapped, where the yay at?
Ain't nothin' nice about the criminal life
Knives and guns and the chains and the teens in gangs
That done dropped outta school, he too cool
To read a book, see nook, crooks wind up on the news
The earth rattle, the over contaminated cattle
The enemies sail across seas to do battle
I know, I used to do those, now I'm retired
I desire not to have my soul burn fire
Everybody got a nickname and they clique bang
Rumble you can hear it through the concrete jungle
I spit it so well cause I see it all day
Homemade, pushin' sledge, spittin' gettin' that
Ladies say hey come close, I don't bite
I go to class durin' the day and I work at night
I go where I want and I do what I like

That I wrote and I quote that it's dope from the top
Please don't you quit, oh Snoop can't stop
I rock non stop when I have that mic
I give you motherfuckers just what ya like
You can bounce, you can pop, but just don't stop
Cause when I take the mic I plan to make your body rock
And don't you quit and don't you spit nothing to me
Cause you can't do me, why you talkin' madness you handed
Your microphone to your mouth now
You couldn't spit nothin' couldn't even turn it out, dumb ass
You got jealous and the fellas got mad at you
You couldn't do what the L.B.C. Crew do
You couldn't do what the D.P.G. niggas do
And you damn sure can't do what the L.A. zoo do

Aimin' at the liberty blastin' artillery
My mental mind state is to build and create
And to weed out suckers, cremate motherfuckers
Mail through, put it down on your whole military
Pen ink scary like death at 13ths

[Snoop Dogg:]
So all you alley cats get your eyes off the trash
And beware the bow wow cause I'm bitin' at your ass
And got you barkin' at the wrong tree, nigga
Can't you see we got the whole game locked like the penitentiary, nigga

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
What you watchin' the clock for?
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'...
Me and my niggas just keep on dippin'...
But I ain't set trippin'
Yeah... Throwin' down y'all
They fucked around and let some dogs in the zoo
I've never seen a dog at a zoo

"[Verse 1]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish ?rope? with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, ""Baby please, you out here serving stress""
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

[Chorus]
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

[Verse 2]
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

[Chorus]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 3]
I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said ""Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted""
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like ""Warren, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

[Chorus]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 4]
Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, ""Can I be down champ?""
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
""Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You caught the vapors

Uh-huh, hmm... I was chillin, right around my way (way!)
21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin shit with his homies like he was a straight.. G
Askin where I'm from while he runnin up
Gangbang, my set on e'ry one of 'em (true)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close
It's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, ""You know who we are""
He said, ""I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg"" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead now I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case really you could see
I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck yo!
See these niggas proceed to speed
So fulfill the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth God... damn!
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact I could be ""Beast of the East"" motherfucker!
I never hesitate to blaze (blaze!)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples
Is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Put the bang on the song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by!)
It's a shame but somebody's gotta die (die!)

And when they catch him in the hood, he gon get checked
Young G you better be where you say you’re from
Where you from, cuz? Wannabes

What she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two
That's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do
But instead of goin' 'upside da head'
You bought her a 5 karat wit your bread
And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head
I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do
When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do
What we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight

And you sleepin' on tha copeasack

To be a high roller, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca-Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my [nigga's] shoulder
Mad dreams, of a gangsta being like Cagney
Or Bogey but Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man I'mma general
So when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homey
And I'm the big homey Snoop Don Corleone

Keep your eyes on your enemies cause some niggas kill

Keep your dick in your pants nigga, cause they'll play ya

And what is a gangsta if he can't mack?
Well I can do it all baby, just like that
The grass is greener on the side I live on
Doggy Dogg went soft, motherfucker you did wrong
But why he on peace, If he was a beast he would've took off on the south Midwest and the east?
Chill, y'all niggas don't get it, and you'll probably never will
It's hard to be real
But it's easy to kill, that's probably why I keep my game on the top of the hill
They keep my name on the top of the bill while y'all lost out there, poppin' them pills
You could've been with Snoop Dogg, rockin' the bill, hop in the veele
For real, I'm out clockin' the meal

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a east side nigga on these west side streets
In my G boy stance with my hands on my dick
We the best thing goin', got the champagne pourin'
And we put it down, come and do the damn thing goin'
I'm a self-made millionaire, the boss Big Snoop
Everything I touch I turn to big loot
This the ZU gang and we ride with Snoop
All I know is that I make that shit do what it do

[Verse 2]
It's the early Berg, it's the grandest anthem
Good day LA, it's time to get back at 'em
Yea, the west coast renaissance
You could smell it in the air, feel the ambiance
And on the road to riches and fancy things
To get a little recognition, be the major bling
Get the ole 6 range, house on the hill, 40 acres in the dollar dollar bill
Big heads in my pocket, hoes in the VI
Mad dough I stack, get scratched like a feline
Sip on the bottle mack, lick on the matua
Break it down, twist 'em up like Chicago rock
To the club, hop off, new Jays
Fitted to the back like 7 and 5-8's
I'm all fly with a fly date
I'm here to boogie, don't make me add to the crime rate

Hoes on my nuts like screws and bolts
Fuck bein' a playa, I'm tryin' to coach
I will pick advantage if you'll let me
Have you driblin' balls like Lisa Leslie, test me
I'm goin' release the heat again
You floatin' in the ocean like Lacy Peterson
Run, cuz you don't want confrontation
Masturbate, you're just masturbatin' bitch

Ey mack we blim big
Can't be mad at young Einstein, acceleratin' the game

Nigga I gotta get mine
Lee, I'mma get mine too
Slide through with the candy paint

Got the whole game locked up like Akon

And my boys trippin' hard like nigga, chill

Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

Why you hounding me in the house of the lord?
Watch us, guilty
Ain't no move in the parking lot prophecies
That's why at the benediction, you can't find me
Oh ain't no smiles, ain't no joke
No bitches, please
Ain't no rest for my soul til' I come clean
I'll hear from the lord if I speak
So back off and let me eat, let me feast

The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower

They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth

Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel

Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it

Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, caught me a homerun
Baby was bad and all, she said ""give me a call""
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' 'bout what could pop out and hit the groove
Then she said somethin' about the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird, so I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe...
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with your weave

You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Til' I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(like a pimp, and that's for real)

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe, lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on -
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a ho with her named 'Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little bit and get a t-shirt that say Ms. Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang that's stoppin' you from buyin' me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'ma buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl - bring her, cause I've been dyin' to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her...
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages baby

You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
Trick beyotch

[Too $hort]
I said beyotch, what are you smokin'
A big fat dick comin' from East Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstandin'
Hit the parking lot, bitch I'll be standin' by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trickin' durin' pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort?) Introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet ya, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dogg bitch, you ain't fin' to come up ho
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the Eastside
Not much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'ma tell you though
Can't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night, woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money

You thought you had my grip
But Too $hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(trick beyotch)

I got family members, homeboys
Motherfuckers I look out way before you...",Snoop Dogg,You Thought,"Soopafly, Too $hort"
