"[Nicki Minaj Speaking]
Ha ha, ha ha
It's your girl Nicki Minaj, bitches
Listen, y'all better buckle y'all motherfuckin' seat-belts broads
It's goin' down

[Verse 1]
Fitted down and I'm ready to play
When ya album gonna drop, bitches never could say
Say, ""Fuck I look like giving birds they props?
Bitches act like they hot, but I heard they not""
How the fuck you in the game like ten years strong
You bitches still can't write ya own damn songs
You see me on the stoop man these birds just salute me
Whether I'm in the coupe or the hoopti, Duke see
I'm always with a dude, that'll off the kufi
Let him eat my coochie and cop me Pucci
House in the boonies, rock a doobie
Cock the 22, then spark a loosey
He tell me I'm the one, he probably right
He pressing me like button downs on a Friday night
Your girl get it poppin' like dynamite
Dynamite, the coke albino white
Name one bitch in the game, that I can't murder
Chicken noodle bitches, on the side with a soda
Give it to everybody, like a cop with a quota
Stop playing poker hop in something mocha
I eat bitches, no knife, no fork-a (or)
Bitch want it with me? Living the life lo-ca
Oh, I get it you a joker
Leave a dot on your head, and I ain't talking bout polka
You the type, that be runnin' ya mouth
See you on the block, wanna run in ya house
I'm with that nigga Fendi, never fucks with a slouch
I fuck with dirty money, like what's under the couch
Cause ain't a bitch could fuck with my flow
When it comes to drugs, mami just say no
Either you're on something or you're S-L-O
Had to switch up the flow, let this skeptos (sketels) know
I come, cum hard, I don't come with garbage
Just one phone call, they gon' come regardless
I always got the ball ma, I don't roll with starters
Write my own bars and my flow's the hardest, nigga",Nicki Minaj,
"[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go",Nicki Minaj,
"[Intro: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Pre-Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

(Look at her butt)
Look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me? Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning
Had us running down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason
That I went to school and I finished (yeah)
She told me that I had talent, got on her knees
And prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)
She saw something in me that 'til this day
I don't know if I could be that (yeah)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I wanna run to you, hold you and kiss you
And tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)
Thought I would have a son for you but now it's official
It's over and I can't let you go (oh)
But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like
I'm dying real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt
And when I'm angry (kyuh)
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long, for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meaning of karma

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 3]
Please baby, forgive me, mommy was young
Mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me
I wasn't ready for you
But how the – would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (no)
It's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying
""Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?"" (yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
(More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep – mo-o-o-o)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)

"[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic

[Verse 1]
It's automatic, I'm a runaway train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'mma show you bizarre tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)

There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am

[Verse 2]
It's automatic, some might call it insane
I assure you, I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be falling for me, boy
Yeah, just like a domino tonight tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic when I'm rockin' the beat
Systematically, I'm droppin' your heat
It's just the way that I am

"Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, ""wetter than jacuzzi bitches""

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

[Verse 2]
Half a bar,  just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows

Uh, mmm, kyuh
R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said ""tre-way""
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

He wanna cut like a trim
And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted

I said, ""Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it""

Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub
That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns
Yao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians
Sayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin'
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans
Call Wyclef, I'm a need a couple Haitians
Now where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?
My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bod gal, all my Guyanese?

[Verse 2]
I just found out that I was doper than Amy
Winehouse, maybe
Fresh out the navy
Fresher then a daisy
Used to be on Baisley
Young money bunny bitch please say the baby
Please stop callin' me, I'm such a rock star
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar?
Give 'em my keys, tell 'em valet my car
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far
Now all I need is a real mandingo
Gimme good uhh and distribute my single
Bootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur?

Ahh, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-wa wine
My wine is too dutty
Beam me up scotty
My wa-ba wine

[Verse 3]
One, two, buckle my shoe
No one on the corner has swagger like I do
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I got the 45 special, don't worry
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry
I like mi chicken and mi goat with curry(yeah)
Now, where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up

Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)
Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
""I love Nicki"" scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah, follow the rules)
(Let me say my prayers and get ready for school)
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted

You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin', up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed, when you got that phone call
That's the effect, they call a snow ball

Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs

I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches

I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover

If they yap your gold chain, then they make a plaque of it
No, we never lack on it, run up with the MAC on it
Put a couple racks on it, they gon' put the whack on it
She got the Nicki bundles, word to Stack on it
That's word to Brooknam, that's word to Bucktown
That’s word to Harlem World, shout out to uptown
You know I shine on ’em, I spray sheen on 'em
That’s word to Southside, Jamaica, Queens on 'em
I'm mad Queens on 'em, runn mad schemes on ’em
I never scale back, the triple beams on 'em
My ice gleams on 'em, Wu-Tang creams on 'em
I pull up on the block bumpin' Biggie ""Dreams"" on 'em (Woop)
Hunnit degrees on 'em, but I freeze on 'em
A light breeze on 'em, I might breeze on 'em
Might do it like it's Christmas and light trees on 'em
I see the copycats bitin' my steez on 'em

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, llevame a la coco, yeah a la a coco

Never trust a broke hoe, don't fuck with po-po

Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown & Nicki Minaj]
Gimme some bloodclaat, gunshot

They call me Ms. Bitch, but I don't miss, bitch
Got real shooters, better D up, guys

All these jealous bitches on the jelly team
Keepin' it a hundred, that's a jelly bean

Bitches ain't serious, man, these bitches delirious
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors

Never mind my money; never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks
Pink Friday, two milli; ""Super Bass,"" triple plat
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same
When I'm sittin' with Anna, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sittin' with Anna

Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
Put these bitches on lock out, where the fuck is your roster?
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

But don't tell them I said it, let's keep it on the D-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost about six figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?
Flyin' spurs for hers, mean I'm fuckin' above it
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it Casper
But this shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I styling? I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waiting, 'cause them pictures will sell
Now don't you feel a-stupid, yeah, that's egg on your face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in your face

I ain't mad at you lil' mama, you a sketel
I'm a winner, you that thing that start with a ""S.L.""
Rhyme with a cruiser, end with a r-ra
Yup, you're a loser, I am a super star-ah
F.A.B.O., I do it, like Toccara
Cause ya'll some dylon hoes
Tryna fuck up my band, I fuck with Nylon holes
I got the pumps and the bumps,the pumps in the trunk
In case I gotta spazz, and blast you mudda cunt
I had to laugh at that one
Bitch get outta line, I'mma slap the fat one
I'm such a maniac
Where Wayne at? I'm tryna get some, brainiac
I gets down, like when niggas is shootin'
Mami, I style wild, like when niggas is lootin'
Hoes is mad, cause these hoes is losin'
They do a lot of walkin', I do alot of cruisin'
Put the top in the back of trunk
Take off a shoe, slap a bitch with the back of the pump
I ain't never had a problem giving bitches the business
Pop bitches in the eye, like I finished my spinach
I'm a New York broad, spend chips in the village
Hopped out the yellow cab, oops, the yellow Jaguar
Girls don't like me, guess it's the swagger
Don't talk to me 'bout, chicks got skills
She's alright, but she's not real
Listen big homie, I'm that deal
I say I body bitches, mean that bitch got killed
Riding the baseline, like I'm 'Quil O'Neal

"[Verse 1]
You be yellin' boom-boom when you really pum-pum
See, my flow hotter than noon in June, June
If Biggie was alive, he'd sign me
I'm the New Edition, like Bobby and Ronnie
Just give me the beat and a bottle of Dasani
And I don't need Clyde, I'm a boss; fuck a Bonnie, ya dig?
Religious like the preachers, I came to warn you
Listen bitches, I'm the teacher, go sit in the corner
How many times I gotta spit 'til they know that I'm the bitch?
I'm flyer than a maggot, I'm on some shit
First they love you, then they switch
Yeah, they switch like faggots
That is why I keep the llamas in Gabanna's fabrics (I'm the shit)
Should be in Pampers, like Markie Biz's
Give anybody the business, like her's and his'es
Cause my flow tighter than them virgin bitches
You know them asalamalakum, them Persian bitches?
And if you miss me, I'm swervin' sixes
Goddamn, ain't even pregnant, but I'm birthin' bitches
Cause I got flavor, like that girl Deelishis
Stop actin' like you a killer, with all them girly disses, bitches
I ain't Johnny, but my, my, my-y-y
She want it with me, tell her affi bloodclaat try-y-y
You ain't thorough, I'm the truth, you a li-i-ie
My whole borough yellin' out boom, bye by-y-ye
Cause when I seen her, she was shakin' in her boots (Word?)

Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me, ""Where you at?""
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
You was the braveheart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me, that I needed to show
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me, you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is, you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us, when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me, you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you

Do it all for GP, tell 'em to suck a pee-pee

The nigga Pap, he might, could fuck me
But I ain't tryna be drip-drippin' a Gino Green
Tell Stacks to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him would he would he yell squad up!
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy
Throw some d's on it & im might breathe on it
And when Im Philly I gotta Fuck Gillie
Snatch his big max & slap a bitch silly

Put the pussy on his freckles, haha that tickles
Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs
Why is that, I gotta watch out gotta get a rough neck
As for Gravy he might could beat
You know them fat niggas love to eat
And when I want a Nicki Minaj who could it be
It's them Young Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Neef
""Nicki what about Fendi? He made you pop""
Tell him to kick rocks, or give me some top
I'm on my way to Jer', to break Ransom off
Quench his thirst, when my pants come off
Murda Mook & Miles gone have to battle
Scoop whoever win and, tell him to sca-dattle
Run up on Mims, he could give me backshots
This is why, this is why, this why I'm hot

Cause money we be taking more, getting cake for sure
Only think about making more
Grey Azzure, mink drag, let it scrape the floor
Don’t be mad when I take your broad
Rock stone, can’t trace the flaw
So I guess in a way, you could say I was made to ball
Act out and the K applaud
Me and Nicki gon’ pay the cost
You wanna play the boss, you gon' learn how to take a loss
Of course I’m back, kid still torch the track
I'm getting paper like Office Max
Branch house with the horse to match
Pink gems, and the cross attached, hit you then I toss the gat
So, G’s up, niggas get your B’s up

Thank you

Ladies and gentlemen
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
New York City

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Nick? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn,  but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go ""Ew""?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

[Hook]
Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to  roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)

[Verse 2]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

[Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Nicki Minaj]
Can I get an encore
I know you want more
(I've become so numb)
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar",Nicki Minaj,

Let 'em live off me till my bank is bruised

Coming down the chimney, you're chopped n' screwed
It’s me bitches, eff you snitches, gimmie the heebie jeebies
So excuse my twitches (Excuse me!)
Lemme get that brewski, niggas know them bitches can’t do it like I dooski
I just pull up, chuck the deuce in some blue denim, and I just heard he running with the lieutenant
I’m the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia
Yes uh huh, Washington
Better ask around, cause I’m what's popping-ton
I’m who they think about, playing with they pee pee
Gotta count sheep b, cause I’m never sleepy
Yes, I’m the chief, you can find me in my teepee… BITCHES!

Chorus

Gudda Gudda
Young Money psycho, straitjacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn to informant
I bring it to your door step, loose lips sink ships nigga
So I’mma bring you to the bottom of the ocean [uh chuuch]
I hear you preaching like a fucking reverend
Should've killed you in the first place, no second guessing
Could've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect em
I could AK or tech em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
Cause I’m God’s gift like a present
For one don’t try me I could give you two lessons
You peasants get murdered if you do test 'em
Gudda Gudda biatch!

To fly

Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'll kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become near when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive

Turn off his phone cause them hoes keep churpin' it
Tell me that I get the fattest pussy in the whole world
And if I let him eat it, I can be his ol' girl
Fuck I look like turning down some head?
I mean that's sorta like a bird turning down some bread?
You can eat it like a treat, you can squirt it, you can skeet, I'm a freak, I love to beat, just don't get none in my sheets
Every time I pop the coochie, Gucci start chokin' me
Now I'm kinda scared I got a feelin' Gucci stalkin' me

They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue, let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I could've went insane
And even now I think, ""Do I really want this fame?""
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show

Who I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties

12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up

I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body

One hot video, you Hype? Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I’m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

Got the domino effect in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call ‘em cashews

Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two!"")
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm telling LA Reid, to step his bid up
And I'm telling President Carter, he picked a winner,bitches like Nelly and Kelly, got a dilemma
These birds all fly south, in the winter
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?

And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal; no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fucking with me if you fucking with Nic'
They ain't fucking with me, they ain't fucking with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fucking Nic, as long as she be fucking rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'alls a fucking trip
Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punching bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunovich""

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' ""push"" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign

I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me

That's why they nick-nicknamed me, Ninja Nicki (Lewinsky!)
I'm such a yes, and you're a no no
Live with a Dragon, and wear a kimono
I'm from the Philippines, badder than Billy Jean
Guess that is why I get more head, than an a guillotine
But then I'm dumb struck 'cause you bums suck
Where the um---where the fuck is my nunchuck?
I'm in Tokyo, with the Cokio
Somebody sleepin' in my bed like Nokio
I'm gettin' ill, I been poppin' a pill again
I'm on an Island, and I'm lookin' for Gilligan
Where my Timberland? I got 'em tremblin'
Can't find my keys, but I know, I hear them jingling
You're such a Marilyn – Monroe and Manson
I'm got some heroin, wanna go dancing?
You at the door? Ok, I'm about to come down
I'm getting numb now, don't let me come down

I know where I'm goin', I knew where I was
Yeah, d-d-d-dirty, dirty south, see my shoe full of mud
Baby who can you trust? Who can you love?
When love kills, like somebody gave Cupid a gun?
It go (BAW!) Like you shooting for fun
And sometimes the solution is execution for some
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one –
A.M. and the conclusion, is you losing a son
No inducing my funds, I smoke the fruitiest blunts
I mean the stupidest buds, I get stupid as duh
I swear my doobie is uh – fat, and just like it, you can get lit
Shit don't stank, when you shittin' in the bank
When her man run an errand, I'ma hit her like Hank
Look him in the eye and a nigga might blink
Aim at his brain and a nigga might think

Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

Alright, uh
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me ""make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

Lemme tell a lil' story, about this dude I knew, he said -
Used to go to school out in L.I.U, he said -
He'd make me a bet, he'd own his own jet, and he'd
Show me the city,from a bird's eye view, said he -
Came from Jamaica, he had a lil' paper
He owned a couple acres, and then I caught the vapors
That's how we got together, on the bike -
Late night, Kawasaki leathers (Ah huh!) He used to -
Wine and dine me,dom and sex and we be -
Arm and armor, 'Mani dress and see I ain't need
A leprechaun, or four leaf clover, I just -
Woke up one morning,and he copped the Rover, see? -
I knew about them girls, he had back then, but -
I was getting money, I ain't care bout them, cause -
They was getting G's, I had M's, I used to -
Split my dividends, with all my friends, cause -
I was in the lounge, they was in the Greyhound, like -
In and out of town,moving coke by the pound, like
Guess it didn't sound right, cause them bitches was mad -
Started plotting, trying to get what I had, see -
My homegirl Teisha, said that Keisha with the  -
Real black lips, used to smoke that reefer, some -

Alicia with the chinky eyes, used to be with freaky Ty
Lived across the street, from this nigga named Tiki Diamond

At the rucker, cause he used to put it down for me

I bought a couple nines, plus, the Ks with me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard: assess the damages
'Cause this that ""Oh,"" this is that ""Oh""
And yes, I body bitches; go get the bandages

Now I'm in the hood, niggas is getting woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies

Made a deal for my project; just give me ten mil', I'm gravy (Gravy!)
I went back to the projects, in two mil of Mercedes
I get head from your lady; have her bill me later
I'm old school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heartbreak hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite

Middle of July, but the wrist on snow-flow (Swish!)
Only do the Aspens
Y'all can have the Poconos (Y'all can have that)
I'm Sonny, and you my son (Calogero)
Ride the whip, five on the hip

Step your cookies up, go get you a ladder

It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away

I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
You bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof, flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they say I'm a Star Spangle

If we in the Oval Office, then the lights out
Cause I am the Wicked Witch, I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R
But I leave her in a second for a thicker

I mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean, my name ring bells like Tinky

Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said ""let’s see""
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines

[Hook]
I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Verse 2]
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you

All them bitches my sons but who's the Daddy?
I graduate with honors, I ball, 'Nead O'Connor
I did a freestyle, then I got a shout out from Obama
Yes, yes, I am ill, I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons, birth control, I am on the pill
What I gotta do? What I gotta do to 'em?
Step up in the club, everybody like who them?

How you gon' break that? How you gon' fake that?
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake pops
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No, they can’t keep up? They molasses slow

Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on the cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leading the blind

Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money

Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'mma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Bridge]
It's okay
It's okay
Long as you know
Long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best, best, best

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me (I hope they comin' for me)
Because the top is lonely ('Cause the top is lonely)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)

Excuse me, honey, but nobody's in my lane

You gotta get that shit wet first, nigga, like, come on now!

That's why I get more head, than a pigtail
Put some ranch out, I’m gettin' the munchies
I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entree
Cause, they be thinkin' they can spit, spit-shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch, let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin', like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin', like a can of brew
Listen, you should buy a sixteen, cause I write it good
That 808 WOOF WOOF, cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man, cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf, where is Little Red-a Riding Hood?

Now, if you see a itty-bitty piggy, in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her ""park it""

Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom

Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'mma just do me when it feel right

Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this

You ain't my man, don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me -
A lil' bitch, when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days, from -
The slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money, it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen, to what a thug say
At night, I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you

Never worry where your income, would come from
Cause no matter, where you was I held you down
Up north, to uptown, so how you sound
Now you all up in my face, 'bout you make mistakes
If I'da known you was fake, I'da laced your steak
Strychnine, one time, in your Welch's Grape (wine)
Quit lying, why you lying? I watched the tape, nigga
Now get up out my dressing room, give me some f'ing room

It's been a long time coming, but you don't know specifics
No more phony wishes, we ready, cause now we know the business
Come holla at your guy, I always make it pour
Invite me to ya wedding, I throw dollars at the bride
It's dirty money, dirty jeans, and dirty scullies
You heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully

Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me, I’m worth it
So, take me or leave me (take me or leave me)
So, take me or leave me (take me or leave me)

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best

Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest
Mortal Kombat, ninja Nicki, who ya pick is?

You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we fuck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry
You could call me Barbie, 'cause I look just like a dolly
Yes, I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to Polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace, this the Queen’s like it’s Hollis
Put 15 million dollars, on it, ask LL, I'm doin' it
Don't get cute and ruin it, all my skill, I hone it
I pity opponents, it look easy don't it

Fax machines, Office Max, see me for that paper
You working with short bread, ain't my money long youngin'
Bitch I'm bout trappin, more digits than a phone number

Now go and get your gangs signs, throw it up!
Where all my niggas on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't going away
My niggas bring the heat, it's not a summer day
So find all my motherfuckin' money, my mind on my motherfuckin' money

Ayo I speak foreign languages and shit but the language I speak is that money language (laughs) flipmode bitch

I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire ('Pire)
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, - yes!
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, - yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ - me!
But I couldn't do it all alone - we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we're done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just reminds me of
Everything they deprived me of (Kyuh!)
P-p-p-p-put ya drinks up!
It's a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of

Shout-out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh

This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold

These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear

I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only",Nicki Minaj,"Lil Wayne, Drake, Chris Brown"

"[Charlamagne]
Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about New York City. I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say ""What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.""

[Nicki Minaj]
Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.

[Charlamagne]
She does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?

[Nicki Minaj]
Hell fucking no.

[Charlamagne]
And I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.

[Nicki Minaj]
I was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Well, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, ""Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next."" You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.

[Charlemange]
What you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
So, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?

[Nicki Minaj]
Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

[Nicki Minaj]
Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
They're gonna say, ""You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.""

[Nicki Minaj]
""Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?""

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
""Why don't you stand up?""

[Charlemange]
That happens to everybody, though.

[Nicki Minaj]
It does.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

[Charlamagne]
I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...

[Charlamagne]
Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.

Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, ""I did look like a damn fool?""

[Nicki Minaj]
Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

[Charlemagne]
Do you ever think that?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Sometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, ""Damn, she looks like a fool,"" but you're a superstar.

That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.

_________________________________________________________________

[Nicki Minaj]
I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.

I did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.

I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.

But, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?

[Charlemagne]
You can! Why not?

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?

[Nicki Minaj]
They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.

[Charlemagne]
Who do you feel that you lean towards more?

[Nicki Minaj]
I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.

That's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.

When I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.

[Charlemagne]
It seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.

[Nicki Minaj]
Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.

It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.

At a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.

[Charlemagne]
I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.

[Nicki Minaj]
And is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, ""Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen."" Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?

[Charlemagne]
She's winning!

[Nicki Minaj]
So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.

And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
""Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...""

[Nicki Minaj]
Safaree... Safaree...

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Do you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?

[Nicki Minaj]
I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

[Charlemange]
How can the author of ""I wish I could enjoy this moment for life"" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?

[Nicki Minaj]
Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Pause!

[Nicki Minaj]
And then all of a sudden it's like, ""Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?

[Charlemagne]
Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.

[Nicki Minaj]
And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.

I've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, ""No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place."" It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, ""Are you sure you're ok?"" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.
_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
What is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.

Being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, ""She's obviously here for something."" I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?

[Nicki Minaj]
I have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, ""We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!"" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.

But things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like ""They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time."" How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.

I think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.

It's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.

I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, ""Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school,"" or ""I got my GED, I'm good."" And I don't want my fans to think like that.

I have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, ""Look, Nicki, Look."" Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.

One day, you're going to look back and think ""Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?""

We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?

Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?

Technology has changed – you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like ""I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes."" That's my bigger goal in life.

[Charlemagne]
How do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.

I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
You wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, ""It's so crazy. She's so famous."" If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.

The other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.

She really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, ""I'm this person"" or, ""I'm that person."" She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?

[Nicki Minaj]
We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.

[Safaree ""SB"" Samuels]
A butt with lyrics

[Charlemagne]
How did you get out of that?

[Nicki Minaj]
Because I created a brand.

People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.

It's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, ""What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,"" until you get here and you are like, ""Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?"" And he's like, ""Yep. Now let's see who really want it."" But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...

[Charlamagne]
You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. ""I'm tired of being humble.""

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm not a cocky person by nature.

[Charlemagne]
Scaff, be cocky for her!

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!

[Nicki Minaj]
What!? What would need to be sucked? On you?

[Scaff ""SB"" Beezy]
Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.

_________________________________________________________________

[Charlemagne]
I just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, ""Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?"" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.

[Nicki Minaj]
Thank you, darling.

You keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy

How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No, you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you
Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?

And you say ""No you,"" and I say ""Screw you""

And I start cryin', and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal

I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad

And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her

You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony

Hi, I'm Tune, salt in the wound
I'm up in this bitch - pardon the goons!
Throw dirt on the floor get caught in the broom
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon
I got the money and the power, a woman in the shower
And she don't want nothing but my Johnson - Howard
Sour Dies in the Swisher Sweet - sweet and sour
You're scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible
Ah! I don't know what y'all on - please
I go in like ""goin""
Drink in my hand with the world in the other
The Uzi go ""brrrr"" - stutter
Life is a puzzle - jigsaw
All I do is win - my name should be ""Victor""
Haha! Old-ass rappers
I'm still the shit! Old-ass Pampers
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin
I was just dumpin my ashes, I'mma puff it and pass it

Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'mma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite

Look (fucker!)

[Verse: 1]
When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
""Nick-Nack, Carry Crack"", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

[Spoken: Nicki Minaj]
You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

[Verse: 2]
Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I tell a bitch this: ""I'm not impressed, bitch""
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars

Late Night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

No ball, but peep game

Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me

And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is 50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
(Nothing I do is good enough for you)

[Verse 2]
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
– Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches

[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile (Still I might)
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi (I'mma keep my eyes on the price, oh, oh)
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi (tell 'em hi from me)
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce (when we reminisce, reminisce, baby)
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz",Nicki Minaj,

You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin' but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I'm rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back 'cause they know I'm the frontman
Put me on a dollar 'cause I'm who they trust in
Ayo SB, what the fuck's good?

But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey, yo Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP

And I'm tighter than face lifts, flyer than spaceships
Now as for Dread? I met him on Mars

He said that he a Martian, he can be my Tarzan
And he looking for a bad bitch for his squadron
That's how we got together, see he control the weather
I leave my planet never without my um–b–rella
It's Dirty Money, slash Young Money, Cash Money
You-can't-catch money, run-it-nigga-fast money
Getting at Weezy, you coming through me-ezy
And I won't hesitate to do anyone greasy
If he gimme the word then I'm flipping the bird
And then I'm spinning around and I'm gripping the burner
See, I been the bitch since bubble gum and double dutch
You was playing hopscotch, bitch, I been top notch
Bitches is whack, they trash, they just pollution
Write ya own raps, make that your resolution, fuckas

I told her that's she's unique like a boutique
And I got her and she said she got me
Now let's go, she with the boss and I'm the boss
""He the President, yeah she Lewinsky"" but we never get caught
And I could give her brain back because I'm so smart
Fuck with my bitch and I'mma draw like Picasso art
Yeah, I spit at you like a hot beat
And nigga if it's not her then it's (not me)
Yeah, as for her I met her on Mars and she said
""I am Minaj, and I'm gooder with the bars""
She got me with her charm, my wings on my arms
Now we flying over chicken heads, shitting on ya farm
Like sitting on a thorn, like sitting on a horn

"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

Don't wanna let the tears begin

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)

[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ay!)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ay!)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when

Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)

Pretty ladies, are you here?, truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

One last time for us to go higher

We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, ""What you doin', Nicki?"" Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot

Calling me at 12:47 in the night

Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight

Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?

Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?

Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came

Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es

Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet

And when I say caking, I ain't talking 'bout baking (Oh , okay)
But they gon' get it all wrong
Fucking with them fake thugs and them fake Don Juans
Say he got workers like the kids in Hong Kong (Stop lying!)
But he ain't getting chips unless you count them Bon Tons (Oh shit!)
Tell that nigga womp womp
Cause you ain't getting chips unless you count then Bon Tons

[Spoken]
How the only chips you got is Bon Ton potato chips?
Like, that's what I don't understand, I try to tell these niggas, like, you can't be serious
I'm Nicki Minaj!
Other than that, like, if you can't see I'm the best
I mean really, you know, these bitches so washed up
I'm walking around with them dryer sheets
Like, you know, the sheets you throw in the dryer
Yeah, I'm walking around with them sheets now
Cause, like, when I see these washed up ass bitches
I'm just throwing them on bitches like, real talk, like
I'm just throwing them on bitches like
Bitch, hit the dryer, you washed!

Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

[Verse 1]
It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22?
Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches whatchu know 'bout me, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

[Verse 2]
Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's cause I get, I get, I get busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me (no)
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf-clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Look, all the kids sweat Nic like a Mexican (mira, mira)
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan—
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know' bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'

"[Verse 1]
I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Verse 2]
I used to think that we’d reunite
I’d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Bridge]
This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Outro]
You’ll always be mine (yeah, baby)

"[Nicki Minaj]
I got a fetish for boys, that's pushing them nice toys
A fetish for dem boys, that's fresher than altoids, I got a -
Thing for a dude, in a fresh pair of Mauri's
If he rocking 'em right, then I might let him call me
He put the Prada bag, with the Prada heels wid it
The Louis dufflebag, had about a mil' in it
From here to Trinidad, man I should've been did it
Cause everything I had, I just doubled them digits
That's the kinda dude, that can roll with the President
Sit up in the Rolls maybe, roll to my residence
Stay around Fendi,, he love my spaghetti
He let me do my thing, he ain't never act petty
If he ringing, I'm dipping, put the ring in my lip and
I just give 'em wink, what the fuck did you think?
Now he spending and tricking, so the chickens is tripping
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, ha ha hahahaha HA!

Errday my birthday
Young Money sipping rozay when we thirstay
Okay, c'mon

[Lil Wayne]
Good Evening New York! (Water crashing against shore sound)
That mean I live by the beach
Sand on the welcome mat, flyer than a Falcon
Black tires, black rims, just to help em look good
In the summer, my car look better than your woman
My woman look better than your momma
And I don't wanna name, or number, just some brain from her, naw
I ain't came in a Hummer, that's a Bentley Marlow on her
I'm nasty on the beat like the runners, I'm a gunner
Like a hunter with a gun, with a deer right in front 'em
I'mma send him to who brung him, let Nina Ross Tongue him
Oh back to the subject, I'm balling without a budget
I'm a big spender, but I ain't done yet
Ima keep that shit running, like I’m Marshall Faulk’s son and
On a Sunday,I’m Devin Hester, you don’t want to punt it
You do it but I done it, I stun it, I spun it

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, yo, he the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S-s-s' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

Shawty, I'mma only tell you this once, you the illest

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S-s-s' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
""Konvict"" just like Akon
'Cause you know the Snitches be putting the Jake on
