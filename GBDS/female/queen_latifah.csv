"[45 King]
Let's start the show off, sisters ago look alive
The Queen Latifah, the King of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats, she rock rhymes, so I
Gave her
A sample sound, the she added a compound
Word, this is for those who haven't heard
A King and Queen combine minds and trample
Thos who oppose us, here's an example

[Queen Latifah]
It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set
The competition is petty and ready to step
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken
Queen Latifah's outspoken
Use your imagination, picture this
Any male or female rapper trying to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth, feed the needy
Confident decendent of Queen Nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation

[45 King]
Technician, musical musician
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most
Creativity, you get a double dose
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em
I rock, never hyperventilate
Others get tired, could use a commercial break
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias
It takes a ton of MC's to prevail against me
Just listen, I'm unstoppable
You want a mission?  This one's impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it
If the style fits, I wear it
Many attempts were made, none was recognized
45 King said sample soundified
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer, I got the formula
And said the man from self, I'm warning you
It's my domain, just ask my chauffer
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa
On top, it's a usual act
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing",Queen Latifah,A King and Queen Creation,DJ Mark the 45 King
"[Chorus 2x:]
Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl
Standin' 'round waitin' for my queendom to fall
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got

I'm tellin' you straight up, all sleepin' beauties better wake up
I'll tear your state up, so set the date up
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it
Who did it, who does it
From private to public
Anywhere I'm in there and been there
So recognize this, who the nicest
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes
Whatever you want I got
Whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop
So notes, pause another spot
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you
Don't try to be me, do you
Be coo' to you and do you
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane
I am the Queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames
Leave 'em all with shit stains
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day
And for real, spittin' on imbessiles and spinnin' wheels
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all
Mic for mic, steppin' to me you gonna fall, we brawl
Throwin' a two-piece so loose leafs
It's the Q-U-double-E-N
You know how I'm MCin'

[Chorus 2x]
See physically you not ready
Lyrically you not ready
Mentally maybe
Who talks tough, time to get the baby
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on
From dusk 'til dawn from night 'til mourn
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks
'til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk
So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time
It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin' in the air
Like a chandilier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty
Even though I'm low-key, you know me
You be singin' over my tracks like it's kareoke
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff
Droppin' math'matics, layin' you out like craftmatic
I'll let you have it, so you don't want the static

[Chorus 2x]",Queen Latifah,Bananas (Who You Gonna Call?),Apache
"Yeah, well, well, owww
Yeah yeah...
Bring on that pecan pie
Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl

I offer big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
Pound by pound by pound

Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
Face the fact, the simply irrefutable
No one wants a meal that only offers the least
When girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast (oh ho)

Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese (woah)
Then take a look inside my book of recipes (ooo)
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
We need a man who brings a man-size appetite

I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice (oo ooo)
We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot

Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable (oo oo oo)
Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid (ooo)
When Edna, you look like the whole parade

They say that white has might and thin is in
Well, that's just bull
'Cause ladies, big is back, and as for black
It's beautiful

All shapes and sizes, follow me
Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree (oo, oo oo oo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah, prove it baby, prove",Queen Latifah,"Big, Blonde and Beautiful",
"[Intro:]
Why y'all ain't say—?!
Yo, you KNOW
You know you was supposed to say something to me
Ooh, baby baby!
Aww yeah
Clap your hands, y'all...

[Verse 1:]
Check it!
Dig it while I rip it
Check it while I wreck it
(Give it to 'em, La!)
Okay, gimme a few seconds
First, I give a shout to every
Jersey-born-and-bred head
And everybody in New York
From brunettes to red heads
Who got my back? (Jersey got your back!)
Yo, tell me who got my back? (The Bronx got your back!)
Yo, tell me who got my back? (Brooklyn got your back!)
Yo-yo-yo who got my back? (Uptown got your back!)
Thank you as I come back into the beat
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me
You know you're too good to be forgotten
Papa wasn't there but there was Lance in the house
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days
I used to rock it on the high school stage
I used to drink 40s
Back then I didn't blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days
Just go on to let you know I flow on
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on (hoo-ooo)
That's what we about to do (hoo-ooo)
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop

[Chorus:]
But chill
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Just chill
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Yo chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh
(gimme five on the black hand side)
Come on chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)

[Verse 2:]
Check it fear don't live in here
Tears don't bring me cheers
So gear for another year because I had it up to here
Yeah, I'm about through with you
You wack and rooty poo
Rip up a crew after I hear the one and the two
I'm ret' to set it off again
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin?
In fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack
We'll play any show and I know that I'll pack it
Attack it with my tactics
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket
I flip mines to get mines
I'm happy to get with you
But you can't come out to play right now
You got to much shit to do
It's all game
It all sounds the same
Them suckers know my name is
Sitting on the tips of their brains
But they're ashamed
They scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy
I'm the La La La from Halstead
Bred with the Queen as a prefix
It's off with your head
And that's a promise cause I don't make threats
So mind your neck, cause it's about to get set

[Chorus:]
C'mon set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Somebody set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Watch the La, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)

Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Watch the La, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Checks the Queen, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)

Parlay
Ah uh, yeah (3x)
Black reign 1993
I'd like to welcome you to this album
Matter of fact, I'd like to welcome you to a new day
A new day to hear me
Check this out ya'll",Queen Latifah,Black Hand Side,
"[Chorus:]
Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
That's what I want from you
To thine own self be true
Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
C'mon, 'cause we're in this together, y'all
Let's try to make our hoods a little better, y'all

[Verse 1:]
Last night after I prayed, I layed my head down
Tired after a hard day
I blocked out the siren sound
As I fell into a deep sleep
I don't have dreams of cream
My dreams are vivid and seldom seen
And much to my delight
I saw my peoples in a different light
Tension was gone
We stood Black and strong
Instead of a day
We had a lifetime of atonement
I felt loved
I didn't have to treasure the moment
Instead of drugs, we gave out hugs
And you payed with pain
No more thugs and
Everybody knew everybody's name
No tricks, no cheaters, women beaters, pimps or whores
Less stress, and a whole lot less liquor stores
Children played without worries of strays
Longer days with shorter nights
No need to fight
We all stuck tight
We stayed away from the traps
As a people, we lived right and exact
And showed a whole lot more of that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
In my dream, we all loved our neighbors
Did each other favors
And used the good sense God gave us
Watched each others' backs
And lifted while we climb
There was no crime
None of my brothers was doin' time
And they treated all their sisters like ladies
Women didn't worry because their men didn't act shady
Mothers were proud of their seeds
And kept a big smile
'Cause the whole village chipped in
And raise that one child
We supported our local Black-owned stores
We were down for the cause
The next man make sure you had yours
There were no robberies, murders, or rapes
No child molesters
We took control of our own fate
The life span of the Black man increased
Times were less stressed
We did our best to live in peace
We showed love for rap
Kept in contact
We stayed away from the traps
And showed a whole lot more of that

[Chorus]

Now as I wake up to face this harsh mentality
It's just a dream or prayer, far from reality
As I wait, the siren sounds begin again
I get up, walk to my window
Wondering if it will ever end
When I look out, nothing's changed
Hustlers are still there
Lady on the phone yelling how her baby father doesn't care
Conflicts with derelicts over squeegies
Homeless will work for food
""Would you please feed me?""
It's our duty to try and help remove some of the stress
Every 20 minutes a child dies a violent death
Parents are frustrated
Wondering where they went wrong
Knowing that that fast money, it won't last long
We got some that fight for rights to be equal
Some struggle, and still we commit crimes against our own people

[Hook:]
Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love

Don't let it chain react
Or fall into the traps
It's time to recognize
And start spreading some of that

Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love

Don't let it chain react
Or fall into the traps
It's time to recognize
And start spreading some of that

[Chorus]",Queen Latifah,Black on Black Love,"Antonique Smith, Next"
"Who brings the flavor?
That's me, that's me
Who brings the flavor?
That's me. I got it

[Verse 1:]
Oh no, it's a scandal
I drop upon the mic like an anvil
And they'll praise me
For mad thoughts, I'm crazy
I'm searchin'
Lookin' for the target
You don't know what hard is
This ain't all this hard yet
But I don't wanna be hard
I just wanna flow
Cause rhymin' is my game
And I play it like a pro
So what?
You want to know my name?
Dana Elaine
All hail the queen acclaimed
Drive you insane
Woman with a brain
I'm a Flavor Unit MC
And that means I'm one of the roughest
Def-est, toughest, best-est
Wickedest MCs rappers in the place
But if you try get swift?
I'mma punch you in your face
I'm a higher flier
Why you wanna cry?
I'm already hot, so put me in the fire
Give me a pen and pad and it's over
Bye-ya!
See ya later, alligator
Hey D, bring the flavor

[Chorus:]
Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor, bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor (2x)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh! (2x)

[Verse 2:]
Yup, yup, yup
I be Latifah on the mic and
When I'm rhymin' don't you call my bluff
Because I hate it when I have to get dangerous
It divides, it loosens, and it weakens and it changes us
You want more? Sure
I fill you up like Texaco
I switch to Spanish
And rock it from here to Mexico
Record go, yo
Watch the pro
Let me flow
I'm raking in the dough on the down low
So me no know
Don't get me riled
I get wick-wick-wild
Flex styles by the pile
So smile for awhile
Aware, my dear—
(Kick-kick-kick, snare)
That the flavor's in the air
Oh yeah

[Chorus:]
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (4x)
Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor (4x)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh! (2x)

[Verse 3:]
Peep me cause I'm not sneaky or freaky on the mic
I just grab it, grip it, rip it right
And the girls know it (know it)
And the guys know it (know it)
I'll put your best to a test (wanna bet?)
Wanna bet you'll blow it?
I'll smoke you like a cigarette
Just give me the mic
I'll give you wreck
And save your idle threats for the next rap
I'll take it without the cream
So leave it black
But you can leave the sugar
So I can make green-like-a-booger money
In the bank
No need for actin' stank
It's a sad thing to watch you get gassed like a tank
And spank
Look at the intelligent female I N I
Don't try it
You know I don't buy it
Now, uh, if your get-up-and-go
Done got up and gone
I wrote this song
So you can rock the hip-hop all night long
So I want a gigawatt in the back of your Jeep
So I can blast the shoes off your crusty feet

[Chorus:]
It's like this, it's like this, it's like this, it's like this (2x)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh! (2x)
Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor (4x)",Queen Latifah,Bring The Flavor,
"[Chorus:]
You can say I'm bad to the bone and that's it
You can say I'm quick to start a conflict
You can say I'm swift when it comes to mine
But mischievous all the time
You can say I'm bad to the bone and that's it
You can say I'm quick to start a conflict
You can say I'm swift when it comes to mine
But mischievous all the time

Melody... whoa... ha
Br-br-br-br-Brownsville, Brownsville, Brownsville...

[Verse 1:]
Tanya Montana, what you want?
Scanner
Microscopic camera
Infiltrate plans and scam ya
Get the chips
Triple split
So MCs and fat whips
Fly chicks with wits
Niggas suck us like tits

Fuck it, put they face is the dirt
Watch me do work shitting on bitches
Uh huh, bet it hurt
In a long black skirt
With the long platinum furs
In a long black [?] only my real bitches should be concerned with

Scarlet, I got these niggas scoped like a target
Bout to start shit, convicts flood the market
Charged with the Remy and Henny, rock condoning
She Capone-ing, ride the track like I'm boning

I'll tell you now if your shit is glassy
I'm seeing through like shot niggas
I put the feeding tubes in the ICU
Look nasty, the hottest crew ballers clocking who? I
Dropping jewels, I'll let you rock one too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Easily we fucks with niggas mentals
Lyrical credentials
We presidential, detrimental
Poetic prophets, philosophic when we drop it
Catastrophic street topics
Sonnin' niggas like the tropics
It's all logic
Profit sharing with my plan
Steady building and planning
I be the last bitch standing
In a war zone and chrome
We leave the spot blown
But still shown
God bless the child
That can hold her own

Forget living from paycheck to paycheck
Our styles will make a nigga
Wanna get his face wet
Don't stop 'til I break a sweat
I ain't choose your crowd
Your crowd chose me solely
Pimped out your style like Goldie

In the event you black out
Start poppin' off at the mouth?
Dropping you off down south
With the heat still in your mouth
I'm too grown to be playing with these little girls
Still getting [?]
Make you [?]
Ten times strong

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
O'Hara, the rap assassin-ess
Stay blasting this
Murder style disastrous
I mastered this
Throwing my back in this
Macking this for all the critics
With the Hollywood committeds
Well fuck 'em
We in a minute

Lady McGyver
Conniver
Be the sole survivor
Plot devisor
The move-on-them bitch that's liver
With Diablos jet black across the stars
Word, relax, put on the Marlboro
Headed for Monte Carlo
Camouflage specialist
Hold it down effortless
Be the best and shit
Lazarus soldier
Left your list
Mind the Matahari
White wine and calamari
Behind me, got an army
The fam is where my heart be

170 pounds of brown
Put it down
Don't clown, be around
Like that weak style you found
You get it?
Trying to live until they make me get rid of it
I was born with this gift
And you don't want me to spit it
L-A-T-I --
Yeah, like I really gotta do that
Lose the haters riding my flow talking, ""Who dat?""
Knew that fate was coming when I dropped that hot wax
Now you bummin'
Gotta feel that

[?] for the sport, play it
Bout the [?] stay wet
On flooded [?] from jewelers I ain't pay yet
Kita lace a tight verse
Blaze it right, then I burst
You deep pockets, you like [?]
You talk, we fight first

Get it on
[?] stuck in your ass like tampons
You thought I was up North
Doing a bid and fell off
Check the platinum soundtrack
That's where the fuck I'm at
Lay my head all up in Brooklyn
But Jersey's on the map
The authoritive figure
But you feel me like a nigga
Coming strong across the Hudson
And I know I'm touching something
'Cause you stupid niggas
Tasted this pussy and wanted to loop it
They said it was a hit
Just like this Brownsville shit

"[Intro: Queen Latifah]
Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah, yes, I'm here to testify
No, I gotta speak on my behalf
You don't even know what happened
Can I just tell you what happened?

[Hook: Macy Gray] (Queen Latifah)
He had it comin' (He had it comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there, if you'd've seen it
I think that you would have done the same

[Verse 1: Queen Latifah] (Macy Gray)
I mean imagine, why was he hittin' his woman?
Why was she takin' that? Now picture her fightin' back
Think of the ass kickin', think of his ass flippin' down the stairs
And me at the top smilin', he shoulda stopped wildin'
Now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off?
See why I pictured me on this side of the law
High heels leave holes, you'd-a thought I was gunnin'
Now the cops comin', I ain't runnin' (He had it comin')
Girl, you shoulda seen it, shoulda bobbed and weaved
Before the cops came, got a couple of clean hits
In word the [?] couldn't take the abuse
But I couldn't explain that to the state troops
But you know, girl, yeah, you go girl
Plus I look real cute in orange jumpsuits
This the story I'm tellin' and I ain't changin' nothin'
I just needed you to know, Your Honor

Aight, aight, let's get this over with
Take the mug shot, hurry up the fingerprints, what, the blood clot?
Lil' Kim aka Sofia Luchiani
Keep your jumpsuit, I'm rockin' Armani
Yeah, I bust at him once, but that was just a warnin'
My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin'
I'm not guilty, just tryin' to protect mine
It ain't my fault he ran into my knife 20 times (He had it comin')
Just my luck the bastard ain't die
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked your eye?
Broke your nose 'til it started bleedin'
Kicked you in your ribs, choked you 'til you stopped breathin'
Fuck that, I'm sick of bobbin' and weavin'
Him threatenin' to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I do a bid, cause ain't no way
(Nigga) gonna do me like Ike and OJ

This is for the constantly accused, mentally abused
How many of you been in my shoes before (aight)
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin' up with his tired ass in the first place
Why am I flippin'? I just bought them condoms
I ain't used not one but there was two missin'
Made a new mission, how to catch a cheater
If he only use Coast, you shouldn't smell Lever (He had it comin')
If you know he don't smoke, you shouldn't smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin' you shouldn't yell either
Run up on him quietly, choke him out silently
It might sound cruel, but you gotta love the irony
So explain that, just came back off a trip
And I come home to this, please
He ain't followed the guidelines
So forgive me, Your Honor, but he ran into my knife five times

Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom)
Come one come all
When it comes to lyrics, I bring them (I bring them)
In spring I sing, in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to par-tay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
(One nation under a groove)
House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?

Don't make me wait

Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach ya

Now it's time to run through it
45 King? (Yeah, baby?) Cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (That was cool)
I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum
Give me some

To say ""ride the groove line""
Don't swing the pipe bomb
Listen to the smooth line

From the queen, the Queen of Royal Badness
Remember me from ""Wrath of My Madness?""
It's my rap that rocks this party
I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The Asiatic Black woman, hardcore beat drumming
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation
Come into my house

[REPEAT Chorus]",Queen Latifah,Come Into My House,
"Hey old friend let's look back, on the crazy clothes we wore
Ain't it fun to look back, and to see it's all been done before?
All those nights together, are a special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow, just as long as you're dancing next to me

'Cause it's so clear, every year, we get stronger (stronger)
What's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go (ooo)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (ooo)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go
(oh yeah)(hey yeah) (oh, oh)

Hey old friend together, side-by-side and year-by-year
The road was filled with twists and turns, oh, but that's the road that got us here
Let's move past the bad times, but before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget and learn from the mistakes we made

'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger (stronger)
So don't give up and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go (ooo)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (ooo)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go
(oh, yeah)(hey yeah)(oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh)

Hey old friend come along for the ride
There's plenty of room, so jump inside (jump inside)
The highway's rocky every now and then (yeah, yeah)
But it's so much better than where I've been

Just keep movin' at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need (so you need)
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone (yeah)
We got so far to go!
(woah oh)(yeah)

Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger (stronger)
So shine that light, (ooo)
Take my hand (ooo)
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go (ooo)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (ooo)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go
(hey yeah)

Baby, baby, ooo, (hey)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go
Baby, baby, ooo, (oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go
Baby, baby, ooo, (yeah, yeah)(welcome to the 60's)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go

"[Chorus:]
Brothers better strap they thang-thang
Ladies, don't let them in if they don't have a condom
Brothers better strap they thang-thang
Ladies, don't let them in if they don't have a condom

[Verse 1:]
Some days I wake up grumpy
On other days, I let the brother sleep
But if there's no peace for the peace [?]
I say peace to the beast in heat
Let's talk about a Slim Jim jimmy chance in hell
If you can't protect a peck, your chances fail
That's just the pride I keep
He could great sideways, inside out
But still left on the side street
That's just a bare fact
My definition of bareback?
“Come at me bare? Don't come back”
Slap!
Try fittin' with a mitten
So you won't be trippin' and flippin'
And skinnydipping in the queen's kitten
So come and get candid
Kiss the candy
No claps
Can't stand me if I offend he
You can't be saved by the skin on your teeth
But the skin on your friend
Could be your end, to say the least
Peace
And I won't give a thang
Cause I'm down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Slick, kick a groove
Don't show the trick in you
Fit the move smooth
Or forget it with the stick-and-move
And don't get tricky with the kissy poo
And don't say “don't be cruel” when I'm dissin' you
Kissin' you don't mean stickin' you
And If I was wishing to
Then you gotta know who I listen to
Like TLC
Me in heat
When lovin' me, couldn't care
If your hat was 2 da back, G
Don't turn the caution off
Turn it often
And don't say “always” then “often” and soften
Someday soon, you got to get to love what you got
Then you get love a lot
Get the point, yah?
You get faded like the face of any great sir
Slow down the fast pace, sir, until it's safer
And I won't give a thang
Because I'm down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Some go from this one to that one
From wick-wick to wack one
You face one, you place one
The safe one's a strapped one
And I don't wanna buy my friends
Forget your promises and use your “condom” sense
Or I'm a glimpse
Then I'm gone
So long
The only thing that's on is your clothes
Now go home
And you can ho 'til the snow's gone
And I'll be here 'til the last hard head dead ho's gone
Either strap up or pack up is my motto
You say, “I wanna stay”
I say, “I know, yo, but bye. Go.”
Let's take it to the extent
If you love her, when you rub her
Brother, take her hint (word)
And I won't give a thang
Because I'm down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang

[Repeat Chorus]",Queen Latifah,Coochie Bang...,

All rise for me (all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session)

I've been doing it for sometime, i'm back to blow ya mind!

Rap (verse 1)
Court is in session i'm the judge jury and the prosecution, my word cos mine conjugus
Ain't no need for confusion i'm here to stay me in the rap game party together like fusion
I wanna talk to Illuminati wanna let you ladies whose first hits screen gets me bar
I was dedicated to the party touring oversea spreading our culture to different nationality
From MC like calories what ya need to do is pay homage and make some sister challenge me
Like i said just me on wax i'll be of value and it'll happen when you least expected exactly
If it ain't rough, I can do without it and some of you all MCs in hiphop just making the game crowded
Let's play a little game of elimination or detonation, separate the rack like segregation

Rap (verse 2)
You know whats up choice stay on my piece you ain't no rapper you just play one on TV or radio and CD
Acting like you wanna see me but really cheeky geek i ain't see me
Check out my whole unit row this new kid study my scripts like the dead sea scroll
My M.O i'm in the back of a stretch land-cruise limo paying customer shot dollar dicussing
You see i am trying to hear nothing so i'm back to recap like Elmino, winds blow, clouds thunder spins the earth off its axis
Me slash rapper, slash actress, slash if you trying to front we get your ass kicked, we used P.O.W torture tactics
Who trying to get at us, cos my friends i feel pleasure in your pain like i should never
I should bronx my pimp we should be hanging platinum, pix i'm stackin' em
Classics from me is automatic, i keep' em hitting in the attic
Ladies rock to this, fellas on the floor grab your crotch to this, watch my progression court is in session
Chorus

Rap (verse 3)
Flog your interest, pay attention to every sentence, all rise for me, all eyes on me
Send a shout-out of respect to all my people living, check the check it's gonna be alright
I rule in favor of the unit with a flavour, we make moves this major, this style coming like a pager
And we don't need that feedback, keep that, i know your crew is off the hook, we off the meat-rat
See that i know you wanna be like us real, already we that you can't be that, believe that
Make you jump outta your gatters and boots, sweats and limo suits, we winning my records on the table spinning
All our pockets getting fat while you thinning, you can't fade us we've been hustling since beginning
Put you hands in the air even if you hate us, we master of profession, court is in session

"You know it's over but you don't wanna say
You see the writin' on the wall but you don't wanna read
And now you're hopin' that there'll be somethin' different
Somethin' to change the circumstances of the way you're livin'

But that's that fantasy, that's that reality
The one you love that keeps on changin' personalities
It's always jealousy, too much intensity
I don't remember signin' over my I, identity

'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain

Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains

Now you met me on the fly, I was flyin' so high
You said I can fly too, that's the start of me and you
Chemistry, what a blast, had us movin' so fast
Ooh baby, what a ride when your love is the map
Let's go

Love the way I move in, the crowd still a jewel
I rule it all with these 'cause I got that joie de vive
But like Tinker bell in the story of Pan
I got caught up and Captain Hook is my man
But I want free love

'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain

Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains

If you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you say you will never, never break
Never break the chains

'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light
On this site, somebody cue the rain

Cue the rain, cue the rain
Why you drivin' me so insane? Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains

When it comes close your eyes, I'm takin' over your body
Close your eyes, close your eyes
When it comes I know 'cause I, I release myself
[Incomprehensible] inside, close your eyes

'Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Somethin' beautiful and bright, it's losin' all it's light

"It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)
This MC stands for ""Microphone Commando""
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me

""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said ""Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet""
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me sing while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ""ho""
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music?  That's not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 6x)",Queen Latifah,Dance for Me,

They all give me more lip
So I give ya more music, more scripts, Less actin'

Turn my days in the dark, they find less (let's go)

That people ain't what they seem to be
They all want me torn up
I know there's snakes in the grass
So I pay my staff, to keep the lawns cut
I see all the drama you bringin'
I combat that with positive thinking
I'm me till I'm old and grey
And when that day comes
Imma teach my daughters to be the same way
I am the way I am, I'm from the hood

About the evil that men do

Situations, reality, what a concept!
Nothing ever seems to stay in step
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers
Here are some things I want to cover
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?
Because she's living on welfare
I government can't come up with a decent housing plan
So she's in no man's land
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal

You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom!

[Queen Latifah]
We the people hold these truths to be self-evident

But there's no response from the president

[Queen Latifah]
Someone's living the good life, tax-free
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free
And that's just part of the message
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do

Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?
When someone can put a quarter in a video game
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street
You can't treat him the same
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds
You to a doom, a fate worse than death
But there's still time left
Stop putting your conscience on cease
And bring about some type of peace
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind
It will benefit all mandkind
Then there will be one thing that will never stop
And it's the evil that men do",Queen Latifah,Evil That Men Do,KRS-One

Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get
I want a friend not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know I'll find him some day
And when I find him
He sure won't say

[Refrain]

(fly girl, fly girl
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)
(and I want you to be mine)
(fly girl, fly girl, have no fear)
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man? )

Lounging, sitting in the house
And I'm cooling, first day of the week
So there's nothing to do
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said there'll be days like this
So I called her and we talked for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile

It's cool, cuz 91 is my year
And this time I know I'm gonna hear

(fly girl, fly girl, come here)
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)
(and I want you to be mine)
(fly girl, fly girl)
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man? )

"[Chorus]
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How much do I love you
Well, multiply your love by infinity

Picture a vision of beauty
As we dance by the light of the moon
Your passion so often consumes me
Like the lick of a native tongue tune
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me

[Chorus]

Remember this always
My sweet one
No lie is true
And dude it's not a lie
When I say that
I would die for you
You're so deep within thee
That sometimes your just a touch away
But I can't reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then you""re all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I recieve you
'fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there
I think you know it gets to me
Stop
Don't stop
Ecstacy

[Chorus]

So sweet
I adore you
Come to me
That's right
Come to me

How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways

Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me

Please don't go
Happiness is nothing without you
Stay

I adore you
Hold me

"Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side

I know you want us both and I know the reason why
I can give you so much lovin
But presents, she can buy you
Last night youre in my arms
Tonight Im all alone

[Chorus:]
How long will this game go on? How long?
Oh, oh how long?

Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side

And its plain, plain enough to see that
Youre not the man for me
I can't keep playin games that keep my heart in pain
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do
Than it is to say

[Chorus]
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure
Ill get over you, yes Ill find someone new
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart

I saw you, dont you try to hide
Dont hide it from me, no, no. no

You thought you would hide it, hide it
Hide it from me

Yeah, check you out
I bet you thought I didn't know a daggone thing
I bet you thought you had me fooled, didn't you?
I know you got a chick on the side

So did my cousin
She sent a picture to my cellphone
I saw the video on YouTube
My other sister saw you too!
My niece even saw you with her!",Queen Latifah,How Long (Betcha’ Got a Chick on the Side),
"[Chorus:]
I can't understand, I can't understand
I can't understand, I can't understand
(It's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)

[Verse 1: Queen Latifah]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasn't causin' it
She must be stupid as a fiend
I should have told the child 'You don't step to the Queen!'
Perplexed and I'm vexed cause' everywhere I go
People be flexin' expectin' me to wanna flow
I don't play that, the only way that
I would be playing is if I pay back
And run the playback so whatcha sayin'?
You don't wanna be a sista' in the name of rap
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
But now I'm fed, so it's off with your head
Now
The moral of the verse is your career is through
And don't be fuckin' with nobody who ain't fuckin' with you
If I was in yo shoes I'd let the BS start walkin'
Next time there might not be no talkin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Queen Latifah]
A brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin'
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican
Ain't make no diff to me, so we continued to speak and
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it, I fell in love with his soul
""Aye papi! Aye!"" Was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he used to do me
And then one day when I was washin' our clothes
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose
A girl's number? Hmmm. That struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip, I had to call up the honey
""There was a chick on the side!"" Oh no it couldn't be!
""There was a chick on the side!"" He's down with OPP?
I gave you the whole shabang
Just to find another woman hittin' my thang

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Queen Latifah]
Why the negative vibes? And why do people take bribes?
I don't understand it, yo (I don't know)
Why do bad people live? And why do good people die?
Somebody gotta tell me why  (I don't know)
Why do people smoke crack? And why do White fight Black?
What's that scenario?  (I don't know)
Why do hearts get broken? Why the chumps get choked?
They know I ain't no joke  (I don't know)
Now, with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
It's a crazy ass life and that's my word, it's bond
I'm tryin' to be as logical as I possibly can
But for the life of me, you know I just can't understand
What's goin' on sometimes
So situations like this come out in my rhymes
But Queen Latifah ain't gone just yet
Cause' when it comes to masterin' confusion I'm a VET

[Chorus]",Queen Latifah,I Can’t Understand,
"Oh I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same

I'm taking this time to write you this letter
Cause what we got is good but want to make it better
Yo boo, I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment

I'm not trying to rush things
Not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon
(see it soon)

I want make this official man, I miss you
I feign for your touch and your kiss too
Listen I hope I'm not being to blunt
Don't wanna scare you away, it's a game I want to play but

Oh I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same

(hey)
Oh I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(falling in love, hey)

I know you love it when I call you big poppa
My thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last cause she was insecure
I'm not tryin' to compare myself but
I got health and wealth
And now you dealing w/ the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught
While I stare at the gifts you bought

The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun
Check me now
Like the time we went to six flags
Boostin', tearin' off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover you my best friend

Do you remember the first time I let cha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask god to make you feel the same

(hey)
Oh I don't know
(don't know)
And it makes me scared
(It makes me so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(I'm falling in love again again)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(baby baby baby baby)

(hey)
Oh I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(makes me scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(falling in love again)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(baby baby, oh oh oh yeah)

Is there a place to ease my mind
(place to ease my mind)
(think about you all the time, yeah)
Show me a sign and wish that you would offer me a sign
Relax my mind

Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight
Don't beat around the bush

I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo dana

Oh p.s. guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long

Oh I don't know
Oh I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(makes me so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same

Do you know what I mean

"[Intro]
Uh huh, well the name is Latifah, you hear me coming through
The speaker. Hit it Mark, 45 King

[Verse 1]
I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out
So don't try to turn me inside out

[Chorus]
Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

[Verse 2]
It's so so simply done
When I find that I have to run
Lyrics to music by the King of Swing, The 45 King
The words we bring I write, and sing
Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim
To add to the list of aggravation
Subtracting suckers like a math computation
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples
This is a King and Queen creation
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?
Forget the small talk now, it's time for me to ruin
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal
He grabs it and starts bombing people
Don't listen to me to figure me out
Because you can't turn my mind inside out

[Chorus]
Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

[Verse 3]
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me
But I came here just to party
If it's a show you want, the show it live
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived
When Mark requests my approval, I nod
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God
Altough a taste of my body would soothe you
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it
Latifah is a name meaning ""delicate and sensitive""
But I have no problem formulating sentences
To break you down to the ground
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown
And I am down, but never ever down and out
So don't try to turn me inside out

[Chorus]
Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

Yo what's up this is Queen Latifah in the house
Definetely representin Jersey on the love love
Coolin' out in Cali; shootin' Living Single
But damn I miss home

[Hook 4X]
I can't.. forget New Jersey

(Verse 1: Queen Latifah)
When I think of home I think of a place where there's love over-flowin'
And all my family and peeps I knew when I was growin
Mommy and daddy made me proud to an Owens
Taught me to keep goin'
Straight up but never knowin'
I would become Her eminence and royal highness
The Queen Latifah; no doubt; one of New Jersey's finest
So, set if off
Get 'em up on my own
Cause Jersey's what I think about when I think of home
Don't let no one get close to you except the chosen few
Stick with the ones who meant the most to you
When you were broke and blue, that's how fam do
That's how you stay true around these snakes
That freakin' smile when they hate you
I'm quick to take the ride down for in-town (?)
(Just another day living on a down)
My experience legit, my rhymes is on hit
It's mad truth to the rumor we the shit; I can't forget

[Hook]

(Verse 2: Queen Latifah)
I used to work at Burger King but after takin orders
I used to take the path to Latin Quarters across the waters
When I learned to do the Wop, yo, I couldn't stop
I brought it back around the way to show the people on my block
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so simple like that there is nothin to it
So, we meet at Irvington High halls and after school I'd run
To the Willowbrook mall boostin' with Sulamon
I had a talent for getting 'em for gear
Petty thief, small time crook of the year
But I chilled cause I had bigger dreams than to steal
And Ramsey came for me and Apache to put our voices on a reel
And I could hear myself on the radio
""45 King Special Red Alert Show""
Cause that's what life was all about to me
R-E-P Flavor Unit, representin' Jersey

I think about my mom and my brothers when I'm on swoll
Shakim, when I'm on swoll
My baby sister, when I'm on swoll
Hoffstead, when I'm on swoll
Ill-Town, when I on swoll
Jill-Town, J.C, when I'm all swoll
Irvington, Newark and so on, when I'm all swoll
Recognize the home of my soul
We got Naughty
And uh we got Nicky
We got Redman, the Artifacts and Whitney
Bon Jovi them my bogeys
Bruce Springsteen, and Das EFX
Shaquille O'Neal, oh he'll catch wreck
Tisha Campbell, Jerry Lewis, Tony Bennett
Back spin, or spin it
Thursday, Peppermint I'm in it
Shadow's, I knows no foes in the spot
Cause them peeps is my peeps and my back is got
Nuf' respect to your burough, your block
You're black; I love to see us move as a flock
Unstrapped, against each other
No body armor
Nobody harms a hair on a head, everything's calmer
And we cool, the ghetto stars and fools
We paid the dues
We made the blues
So come on with the come on
Get down with the get down
I'm down with my hometown sound

[Chorus:]
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the (gunshot), but I'm here to stay

[Verse 1]
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be’s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way",Queen Latifah,Just Another Day...,
"Ah yeah
Uh huh
Come on
Keep it going
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try

[Verse 1]
To all my peoples
Ghetto to ghetto
I feel your pain
Trapped in the game
Doing your best to maintain
Another day
Another dollar to make
Accumulating crumbs til you get a meal on your plate
Keep strivin' get more
I know what it's like
Life's hard to the core
I done seen cats killed over 50 cents
Women sellin their bodies because they gotta pay rent
I lost my brother but he's still in my heart
I know he watchin' over me
He the light when I'm in the dark
So I keep my head to the sky
I know we can all make it if we try
Live your life, yo

[Chorus]
Oh, For always and forever (to my peeps in the field)
All my people's get my love
You gotta

We can all make it if we try
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try

[Verse 2]
I know you wanna live life in the finest way
All you think about is your payday
Walkin' through the hood wit cha head up
Tryin' to make a come up cause you fed up
You wanna go from Ole E to Don P
Plannin' out how your future's gon' be
I believe in you kid, You did the bid
Now you back on the streets
So You playin' for keeps
And you makin' ends meets
Gotta do what you gotta do
Ain't nobody gon' give shit to you

True Ballers ain't got time for frontin'

You gotta
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try


[Verse 3]
I was in your shoes before
On the streets gettin tossed
Way before
Living Single and Set it Off
But God came across my life
And molded me
Into the queen that I was supposed to be
And my moms stayed close to me
Through the rough times, through the tough times
When I used to bust rhymes
On the streets in New Jerz
I live for hip hop
I'm in it for life
It Don't Stop
Keep your heart on your dreams
And make them come true
Control your destiny
It's all about you
You can make it through
So Don't Stop, Kid
That's my Word
I'll See you at the top, Kid

[Chorus]
Oh, For always and forever
(to my peeps walkin' with pain, you know what you gotta do)
All my people's get my love
You gotta
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try
Keep your head to the sky
We can all make it if we try
Oh, For always and forever
Oh, For always and forever
Oh, For always and forever
Oh, For always and forever
All my people's get my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh",Queen Latifah,Keep Your Head To the Sky (Japan Bonus Track),
"[Queen Latifah]
The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

[Monie Love]
Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)

(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)

[Monie Love]
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First

[Queen Latifah]
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First""

Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen

[Monie Love]
My sister, can I get some?

[Queen Latifah]
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb

[Monie Lovie]
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E

[Queen Latifah]
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First""

Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right, the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why, cause I'm that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next
Plex, you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift? It's Ladies First",Queen Latifah,Ladies First,Monie Love
"[Intro]
The Queen is hyped up
The Queen is hyped up
The Queen is hyped up
The Queen is hyped up
Ay yo Manda
What's up La?
Yo, people have been trying to get fierce on me
I think it's time I tell them about themselves
Yo, just give it to them Safari Style

Well, well, well
It's the L A the T I the F A H, you'll see why
Q U double E N. Is the reason I must be myself
What else? Well fame hasn't got me
Souped up selling out, sloppy or poppy
There so much to live for, therefore
Here's more from a woman
All women keep the rumors to yourself
The over blown home grown not known
Fools who never shown proof let alone own
A lot of props or a hip hip pop chart
Notch on your clock is my spot
Now who got the Mott’s?
Why you little played out
Aa-choo!
I'm allergic to wack crews
The La, the ti, the fah
The queen is up
Throwing salt that you never seen before
How dare those who talk we can't have them
Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise, civilized and growing higher
Judgments from the Queen punishment is the fire
I'M here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire, face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear, fear
The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear ear
Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge and grace
I never run my piece Damn! I'll take it to your face
Open why you hoping none stutter stop 'em
Maybe choke (choke)
Because it's very hard to breathe while La got you in a yolk
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chprus]
Give it to 'em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em Queen (I got it)
Give it to 'em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah

The Queen L A T I F A H in command

Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to my mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana, bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say ""Is that so?""
Talk is cheap and if talk got any cheaper
They'd be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah, blazay blah, etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La, La
Lovely and lyrically loose, but lady like
Im too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When Im in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks breaks, face face, never never, waste waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chorus]

Royal and loyal
Face the fire boy
You wouldn't get the time of the day
So make way, hey, silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it never ever sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The flavor unit is doing it back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
Feel the force of my holocaust I'm staring at ya
Put in a bid on who will fall I'm sure to match ya
Snatch ya stature
Your broken looks more like a fracture
Catch that rapper
Latifah will be back to crush ya
Go buy a heart
Cause from the start I told ya no one getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chprus]

Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen, the flavor unit

Give it to 'em Queen, I got it
Give it to 'em Queen, Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, DJ A D
Give it to 'em Queen, ease off
Give it to 'em Queen

"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But I'm not buying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me
So don't smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown
The 45 King is arising, suprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for
This is Latifah's Law

BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype, I'm sorry your sound died
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause there's a sucker born every day
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifah's law

Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense
In case you forgot, just check your conscience
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all",Queen Latifah,Latifah’s Law,

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1:]
I wanna rock off the dome
Rock written poem
Rock in cars, clubs, and homes
‘Til everything I’m spitting is known
‘Til I’m written in stone
Got rhymes running through my head
While I’m sitting alone
The Queen with glimpses of thrones
My imagination takes me to other places
In God’s creation
Sometimes I switch to jazz stations
To try to help my patience
Tested with stress from this crazy life I live
Nevertheless, keep my attitude positive
My prerogative is always to have a pot to piss in
If I get shitted on by the biz
Watching this statuesque check holder
Drop to this as you rest in your Rover
The Remy and Amaretto
Got me high like falsetto
Sexy in stilettos
Trooping through the ghetto
Let me head go with my feet
Can’t peddle ‘til my bread grow
Too much in me to ever settle

[Chorus 1] (2x)

[Chorus 2] (2x)

[Verse 2:]
Now I know a true thug
That got hit with five slugs
From other thugs
And God’s angels gave him mad love
True to the game on the real
And I don’t doubt it
How many players you know
Got hit five times and
Lived to talk about it
I even start to think you was immortal
‘Til you caught that shit in Vegas
Guess your body just couldn’t take it
God had to take him
Doctors couldn’t save him
And to my other brother
Murder was the case that they gave him
I know innocent was your plea
And since you got it
Give God the credit
Stay strong and don’t let it
Get you down
‘Cause if you need me I’ll be around
It’s true
You got angels watching over you
East to west
Nevermind who’s the best
To all my peeps
In peace may you rest
Somebody told me keep your head up
Don’t speed your death up
Don’t give your days up
You got to stay up

[Chorus 1] (2x)
[Chorus 2] (2x)

[Verse 3:]
You once was the Notorious and dangerous
Now you ain’t no more with us
It angers us
Another boy killed
Another voice stilled
Will never see the sun rise
Got caught up in the night’s chill
How do they explain to us
The loss we feel
Everybody packing steel
These ways is ill
No exemption
Whether you broke
Clocking grills
Or whether you topping bills
Or making mills
Pac was enough
But they had to take yours
You gone
The shit hurt
Ain’t no reason to fake for
Your wife shedding tears
And your crew
They ache for you
But you got seeds
And we got to make sure
They don’t inherit a world
That’s wicked by nature
Leave it to the Lord
To even up the score
Streets already raw
Full of player haters
Fake for sure
Taking yours
Making the stakes get raw

Well it's a party over here, a party over there
In every nook and cranny, it's a party everywhere
And that you should have known
When I walked through the door
I'm told I got the flavor, I'm told I got the flow
Before you even try to diss me
Let's get something clear
There ain't no fear between you and me or the atmosphere
Hail to the queen and the sire
I'm lighting fires
Your style is wack as two flat tires
It will only take a second
For me to just wreck it
Smoother than my body buck naked
I don't have to prove shhh...
Just keep doin' hits
And niggas be all on my two tits
And even if you think it's odd
I'm telling you, after every single rhyme, I thank God
For giving me the power to make your heads nod

What a beautiful day and I'm riding down the highway
On my way to the studio, gotta go cause I slept late
I just came back from cool ass Cali
Where Mandy was bumpin' MC Ren's in the alley
Driving so fast that no one could catch me
While I'm knocking ""Gangsta Bitch"" by Apache
This is the mood for making the hit hip-hop song
You should have known it was on
The places I've been, the people I've seen
And everywhere I go, it's “Give it to 'em, Queen!”
Cause hip-hop is for real, I'm dealing with the truth
Cause all over the world, it's aggravated youth
So every time I grab the mic, you know that I could rock it
So I can have some fun and put some money in my pocket
You can always know the time, just recognize the sign
Cain't nobody put a padlock on your mind
Listen to me now

Take a trip on back into the third verse
Of the originator of the concept of ladies first
You came along and tried to freak mine
To the contrary, cause I'm not your ordinary piece of feline
See I know the book because I read it twice
If I bite the hook, then I'mma pay the price
Mama taught me Black was beautiful when I was young
And told me all about where babies really came from
So you can hit the door with the theory
That all Black women are hoes, hear me?

Possy, Dovey! (Yes mama?) Time to get up!

Hello, I'm Queen Latifah, how ya doing?
I hope that you're with this, I hope that you're willing
I want to introduce you to a cut called
""Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children""

[Dove]
Well here comes the goy (Goy?)
The truth to the goy
You know the one, that ate up like boy
Stepping with a step, keeping with a kept
Making an appearance with a notty-head set
Lunatics you lose cause the Plug 2's singing
Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in
Weigh-in, weigh-in, way out of order
If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a
Waving mine a peace sign higher than a kite
If you're feeling sick, it's alright it's fever night
Don't do ""Do see do"" and dig in no potholes
Cause if you do we calling in March Patrol
It's no different from the verbal last heard
Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word
He's moving more than three feet, jocking with the knee deep
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet tweet tweet

[Posdnuos]
Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta
Dipped in chocolate, served with lotsa
Twizzlers and honey, yum yum yummy
Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy
Tiptoing in I proceed to the floors
Selling much records like a pimp mover
Excuse me mommy, Pos wins
Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N
Brother freak it live for this tribe
Now let's ride down the highway of vibes
Pushing that we start cause the soul says please
Cutting back with the raps and we don't get cheese
Ducks and we sit need to get ????
Cause preacher is the key to the casualty
Polaroid flicks are back and you know
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons show

Go mommy! (Repeat 16x)

[Queen Latifah]
I'm back, a black queen upon the scene
With a knack for funky tracks, know what I mean?
Prince Paul produces this and it's a fly one
It has a beat that weigh, he's one of my sons
It's a family affair and then we're out of here
There is no doubt here, cause this is our year
So flex to a Queen Latifah/De La Soul sound
(Go ahead mama get down)
It was inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedestal
But the rhyme is so good it's practically edible (Say what?)
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu
As I relay the story untold
And if you're wondering why I got kids so big
They weren't born from the body, they were born from the soul
Go mommy
Go mommy

"My baby, she may not look
Like one of those bunnies out of the Playboy book
Well, I'm sorry bout that, Mr. Williams
But she's got something
Johnny, much greater than gold
Well, now what's that?
I'm crazy 'bout that girl
She's got so much soul

She's got the kind of loving, kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do - ow!
Tell 'em bout it, Watson

My baby now, when she walks by
All the fellows go, and I know why
Have mercy, just look at her walk
It's simply because that girl, she walks so fine
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind

Because she's got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow

And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
I'd better tell 'em one more thing

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Ow, tell 'em bout it, Mr. Williams

Now everybody in my neighborhood
An' that's what's grooving me
Will testify that my girl, she looks so good
Well, let me tell you something else right here
She looks so fine, she give eyesight to the blind
Help 'em to make 'em see
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind

Because she's got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do

"[Chorus:]
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night

When I met you, the first thing I thought was, “Sexy!”
I didn't judge, no
Figured I'd wait and see
We had convos 'til the break of dawn and
I intrigued you, you fascinated me
You told me all about the freak in you
Figured I was seeking you
And I couldn't wait to get a peek at you
But I'm the type that thinks that sex is best
When you're in love with more than the physical specimen
So I waited for your heart to get in touch with mine
And waited longer just to make sure it was genuine
And now I see you're on the real tip
Baby, I can feel it every time you hold me with a tight grip
It's true, it's all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
I'm ready to let you love me all night now
Come on, baby, right now

[Chorus]

All I ever wanted was a strong brother like you
That's why I hold on to your love
Cause you're the earth and I stay down to it
Just like this beat, I expound to it
I live a very hectic life, but I'm glad you understand
Cause when it starts to stressin' me
You see it comin' and forgive my moods and my attitudes
Cause you know how the pressure be
Then you massage my body
Every single inch of me to relieve the stress in me
You've got a way of getting next to me
You've got me offering the rest of me

[Chorus]

Baby I know that I can do it right
All night, all night, all night
'Til the break of morning light
Alright

Many thought they was gettin' kitten fast in the past
Make me purr and then jet in a blur
I don't think so, cause I don't think ""ho""
They didn't get laid, cause I don't get played
But baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
And it's for Y-O-U for eternity
Now that's how my mama said it's supposed to be
Affairs, flings, and those type of things come along
But I'm putting on a ring for my king
Cause you bring it strong
So let's be on our merry way
I'll give you love without a limit like Mary J
It's true, it's all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
I'm ready to let you love me all night now
Come on, baby, right now",Queen Latifah,Mood Is Right,
"(Guy) There I go, there I go, there I go
There I go...
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?
So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us

Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And give a relief from this awful misery?

(Girl/ Backup Singer) What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Can't you understand me?
Now baby, please pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

(Guy) Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a loving state of mind
I'm so tired of being without
And never knowing what love's about...
James Moody, you can come on in man
And you can blow now if you want to

Name callin' hasn't fallen into what I'm runnin'
I wouldn't dis another sista unless she had it comin'

[Verse 1]
Hold my Heineken, 'Pache, I'm 'bout to catch a charge
Bitches that think they hard get snuffed, FUCK the bodygaurd
They need to shut the FUCK up, or step to me
All they can do is be mad at me, bitch, don't threaten me
Niggas don't know I'm nice with these, you pay the price with these
Come by this Pisces, your life cease
You couldn't see me if you looked at my life like Mary
Your style is cheesy, how you gon' beef? You dairy
Better be wary, cuz if it's necessary
Be shoot the joint, I'll leave you somethin' for the tooth fairy
And all you rappers sellin' more sex than skill, chill
I'll rip your style, all the while keep my sex appeal
Don't get it twisted yo, I never really favored you
And I was raised by my niggas from the Flavor U
So fuck giving props where they ain't due
Fuck you and that nigga
Who wrote the rhyme for you too
I got hot, when you play my spot you get laid like rugs
And you'll never be the woman that your father was
Stop flirtin' with my last nerve and head south
Next bitch say somethin' worse, goin' in your mouth

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2]
Another bitch after my crown but I don't hate her
Cuz she couldn't come up if she was gettin' FUCKED in the elevator
What, you thought I wouldn't check your chin?
Though I was your FUCKIN' friend?
See you and speak, tonight all that SHIT ends
Don't act extra, where you from?
High post on low income and then some
Ready to leave your gums numb
Listenin' to you is like wack sex
A premature ejactulation
A quickie, that gets me stressed
You're doin' it but it don't thrill me, BITCH, you know you feel me
Don't get scared now, time to face the real me
I'm ready to break my foot off in your anal
Ready to bring you some pain, yo
Comin' up with that playdough
Style you stole, tried to mix it up and make it blimp
Sound like Lauryn, with a dash of Lil' Kim
We know bootleg, Korean, coughin', schemin' ho
I know it's bootleg cuz they misspelled Moschino
What's worse? Your press-ons, hair or gear?
I should buy your contract
Put your ass on hold for another year
You picked the wrong one, so bring your click
Now we can handle this like ladies
Or get into some ol' otha SHIT!

Makes ya feel like rappers be on some bandwagon shit
But I gets boogie, quick fix with lyrics, from toastin' too many spirits
FUCK all these cheesy bum bitches fakin' these riches

What the deal? Chicks pimpin' they sex appeal
How you feel? (stupid!)
Got the still now, dead up in your grill
Bout to go up in your raw, so you industry whore
Never saw the lights before, now you model and floss
Overload your hold on piece, when I rock shit like this
You can't flip, cuz jiggaboos be gettin' twisted (what?)
All that high shit that you be smokin' got you buggin'
Think that you could step to my crew?

"[Verse 1]

Coming from the bitty bitty bottom of the basement
The first [?]
They want to make it to the top too quickly
So I take [?] all the time

Take a look at the flow of the future
If you can't shake to it, then it don’t suit ya
Break off, back off, beef off, bust off
That is the worst, [?]

Bad this, bad that, who's bad enough?
For those who are bad, then batter up
I acquainted this rap with my index
So, baby, come on with a rag and some Windex

I'm stepping the step tryna meet me there
I’m avoiding all political fanfare
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista

[Verse 2]

Who's a king, who's a queen, who's tryna bang?
I see myself as a queen but it ain't for rank
This for all, not one, not for income
But for knowing who and where we descend from

I kick off with a choke, I come crazy new
They call me Mama Zulu but I won't baby you
I'm not the type to look for a man with cash
But the only thing you get if you're broke’s a [?]

I dip, then switch, what floor is this?
I go higher than a fire, try to diss
This is a little of my [?]
Rippin tracks, whippin [?]

Right on flow, a few floors ago
I see suites instead of concrete, so
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista

Here’s a knick-knack, sit back, hold ya hat
Here's a big rap, ya got close now get back
I got an army bustin through the enemy’s wall
My thoughts on the situation was ""fuck em all""

Salt and pepper said it was time to grow
So me and Spin did em in, now time to go
Yo yo grabbed him, he said ""hey, diddle diddle""
While I [?] out of the middle

Sisters in action, strong, real, still complete
I say ""what up"" cause you can't come or compete
The La, the Ti Fah booms like a speaker
I hold more soul than a sneaker

Don't ask if I'm fast, I come swift, sis
Cause I’m passing an ass if you with this

Don't try to get fly, y'all
We're blackin' up eye balls
I run with a rough set
So don't get me upset
I gas you so hard, I leave you fartin'
You're soft as a buttercup, stupid ass
So why you startin'
You're memorizing every damn lyric that I write
You're all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger
Stop ridin' on my bra, you freakin' strap hanger
Until we play Techs, but I always stay free
I made a resolution for you, 1993
It's all about the Flavor Unit and my family
Cause I would die for all them
And they would die for me
Leary about this intelligent female
All catch hell
An explanation of the Queen Latifah
Spelled well
So blow up and know me
Don't even contemplate a theory about jerkin' me

[Chorus]

[Chant]
Play me like a child, but you know I'm grown
See waterworks, so take your broke ass home

[Verse 2:]
That was the way it started out back in the day
A little singin' joint with the hard core phrase
[?] I wouldn't diss another sister 'less she had it coming
And even then, I would take it to her face
My presence is stunning
Cunning as a venus fly trap
Cause, word up, I fight back
And damn right, it's like that
So step back
I'm not the type of girl
You can run through and drop
I'm not the type of girl
To be running to the cops
I know about everything
That goes on on my block
And right beside my bed
I keep a Luger and a Glock
They're for the protection of
A Flavor Unit queen
Me not gon' let ya go
Until me hear ya scream
I look in your eyes
When I speak to your punk ass
I ought to put my feet to you

[Verse 3:]
Now, this wicked curse hurts
Spank your girls and boys, I'm annoyed
You gots no work, so I lurk to keep you unemployed
I'm a part of a tribe with a vibe
I scribe with nine lives
You're kicked inside outside
I used to ride the path
Across the tracks in your mouth
Until I jumped the turnstyle
And the conductor threw me out
You feelin' kinda horny?
Call a clinic on that grout
You's a dingy, dirty bitch
So I gotta Shout it out
I had it up to here, plus there
Cause I'll be here plus there

Nigga-niggas say the hood ain't changed
I get my niggies with the hoodies
Far from goody, but they're bad instead
We're ready for the worst things first
Anything you thought, I thought twice
Thought through, and thought first
The queen picks the verse off a shirt
You hurt when I smirk
Cause you know first

You ain't got no work for the queen (no work)
You ain't got no work for me (no work)
You ain't got no work for the queen (no work)

I'm runnin for the fences, of course I'm relentless

Now nuff of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin, I show and prove, not show and tell
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin
It's a love thang, the Queen doin her thang
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tanq'
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?

Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n rays
I got flavor for days
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and
]From me you know you get a worth for your money, and
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to 'dance
For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'
They felt the 'wrath of my madness', I let them 'come into my house'
It's called 'latifah's law', for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule: 'ladies first'
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall vitim to the 'evil that men do'
Small puff, I call your bluff
I'm not mad, I just had enuff of the ruff stuff

Don't get caught up in it
Talking about straps and gats
When the only tools you had had water in it
Wait a minute, I'm about to spark shit
If you smoking 20 blunts a day
Chances are you smoking garbage
A whore bitch? No me, no never
Too clever, too feminine

"People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

Listen, money crimes and mood swings
Situations where certain people will do things
Like hop on bandwagon, get on the food chain
Soon as you get yo swag that's when yo crew change

But we all equal and people are just people
Leave it in God's hands 'cause the devil is lethal
You get what you earn also you live and you learn
To expect nothing in return

Do what you do from the heart then move on
'Cause in the eyes of the ungrateful, you can do wrong
That's when the negative energy gets too strong
The sunshine leaves, in comes the true storm

Sometimes make you wanna do harm
But you fall back 'cause you too calm
To get all rowdy and evil 'cause you realize
At the end of the day they just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

The bad ones discourage, the good ones motivate
The weak shall perish, the haters going show they hate
As long as you know what you dealing with, you can close the gate
Never let them in yo world till you know they straight

'Cause then again they just people
Life's just a one stop deal, there's no sequel
Fake ones are so transparent and so see through
Love ones can be so humble when they need you

Some got they hands out even after you feed 'em
But they ain't never around when you need 'em
That's when yo thoughts get evil
But then you realize they just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

Ayo, I got a lot more living to do before I leave here
'Cause I'm blessed and I'm thankful and I'm happy to be here
In good health with good wealth, you could always use help
But all you really got is yo good self

Still what I go through, it hurts when people that know you
Let you down and don't hold you
But yo mistakes will teach you

"[Verse 1: Ursula]
I admit that, in the past, I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, ""a witch""
But you'll find that nowadays I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes

And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf of the miserable, lonely, and depressed
""Pathetic""

[Chorus]
Poor unfortunate souls in pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
This  one wants to get the girl
And do I help them? Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula, please!""
And I help them!
Yes, I do

[Post-Chorus]
Now, it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake them 'cross the coals
Yes, I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

[Ursula]
Now, here's the deal: If you dare
There's a potion I’ll prepare
Just consume and you’ll be human
Three whole days up above

By the end of day 3
Listen up this is key
Just convince Mr. Prince
And get a kiss of true love

[Ariel]
If I do?

[Ursula]
Lucky you
You stay human through and through
You can go, wed your beau
And be totally divine

[Ariel]
And if not?

[Ursula]
Then guess what, girl?
You’ll turn back into a Mer-Girl
Same as you once were, girl
But that tail will be mine!
Don't be shy, dear
What will it be?
You want the guy, dear?
Leave it to me

[Ariel]
But what about my father?
And my family?

[Ursula]
Hmm...
Sorry, dear
There's no way to spin it
Life's full of tough choices, innit?
One last thing, silly me
Did I mention there's a fee?
Nothing choice, just your voice
No more talking, singing, zip

[Ariel]
Not a word?

[Ursula]
Not a note
Not a whisper from your throat

[Ariel]
But--

[Ursula]
Show some spine, you'll be fine
Honey, here's a little tip:
You'll have your looks!
Your pretty face!
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

[Verse 3]
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes, on land it's much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all, dear, what is idle babble for?

[Chorus]
Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead, make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad, but true
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
You've got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll!
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys!
The boss is on a roll!
Those poor unfortunate souls
Beluga, sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me
Now... sing

Keep singing!

"[Verse 1]
Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
Forgive the crowds, O Lord
They know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib

[Hook]
The call me the high priestess of disaster
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been, a piddly pastor

[Verse 2]
I reign, the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light

[Chorus]
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

[Verse 2]
You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn
Let me know now if you would like to protest this proceeding
A greeting, or would you rather progress
Onto a higher plateau, truly I'm taking it slow
Enough for you to seek the knowledge and to know
I'm the Q-U-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H
Queen of the R.E. Posse, the GLA which is Get Live Alright
You standing there chewing on your fingernails nervous
Watching me doing the live thing
Singing like a bird sings, ringing like the phone ring
I'm the Queen and you're the underling
I'm never following, I follow none
The princess of the posse is a cool one

[Chorus]
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

[Verse 3]
I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land
It's a concoction, for my ability
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility
Cause they don't know I'm the one to front on, or two
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
I'm kicking gold, so grab a hold and get a good grip
Stop the lying, the trying
The time buying, you've been denying
'Cause you're dependent on me, the princess of the posse
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King
To the posse, peace
Got to let you know where I come from
The princess of the posse is a cool one

[Chorus]
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

Latifah run the family
Me say me haffi do it for the R.E. posse
You try to be down, you can't take the crown
Maybe from someone else but not me

You try to be down, you can't take the crown
Maybe from someone else but not me",Queen Latifah,Princess of the Posse,
"Let me remind you of how to unwind your body
So dance and shake and just keep in step
Understand, draw a clear picture
What I'mma hit you with is truly def
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom
All competitors, I simply cream them
One by one, I dust and brush them off
If you have any more, bring them
Up to the front so they can show me what they got
What they got, it better be hot
Cause if it's not, I'mma simply knock them out the box
And they'll be put in a spot
The style I use will surely amuse
The party people to a state of gladness
What I mean is I'm on the scene
I'm the Queen of Royal Badness

Well it's the LA, the T-I, F, A-H
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking
Not freaking, this is a Queen speaking
Wise words, when I'm done I'll leave your eyes blurred
When you address me, address me as ""Your Highness""
One of hip-hop's finest
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo
It makes me no different, so
Play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?
Observe my ways and actions
I grab the mic and draw attractions
It takes two to tango, I'mma hit you at all angles
Those who did I caught a fit and strangled them
The result when a pen and a pad
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness

I can't wait until the party is jam-packed
When I start to drop it, the people say ""Damn, black""
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly
If you don't dance, then grab a chair and plex, B
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell
Guard as well as you can or step
Off the premises, in one minute it's
Going to explode in a style that is limitless
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss
It's no doubt I got clout and I'll bust
Literature that flows like liquid
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it
So don't say nothing
Just listen up, follow instructions
Rock, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said
When I'm on stage in cold rage I drop heads
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness",Queen Latifah,Queen of Royal Badness,

You come to the party well prepared then get scared
You're through and need stitching up, You and your crew start bitching up
Where you gonna live around where I'm not stompin' It? I really believe you're a wee bit ova confident

Here comes the queen, I'll make a woman on the track get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap
You're looking for a friend to the end, good, that me
But if you're looking for a Gangsta bitch
That's exactly what you're gonna see
Ain't no way, Ain't no say, This ain't your lucky day
So go pray, Now you pay cause I don't fuckin' play
Matter fact, I think Ice-T, he put it just right
""You diss me on record? See me? Fight!""
Just throw up the joints and get to the point
And cut all the talk, the BS can walk
Cause I ain't here to waste my breath
You test my skills, you get put to death
I'm sick of all the huff, puff, blow your house down bull-
Shit I heard last week
You get ya ass beat
So Watch the way you approach the Queen
If it ain't rough I'll send that ass to the guillotines

"[Chorus:]
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you ain't gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can

[Verse 1:]
My girlies caught me on a good day
I was bored, in the mood for jugs (?)
So we took it to a club
Thinking we would mingle a little
And plus, at the time, I was single a little
So I said ""Fine, we could meet up about nine.""
So anyway we goes in the place
Word up, it's flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we know and
The people in the joint is yelling, ""Hurt me! Hurt me!""
I'm working my way over to the bar, cause I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he sights me!
I smile cause he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me!
But then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me
Cause he's scared to get dissed
I don't bark, baby?!
I don't bite neither!
You could have asked me yourself
For my number to my beeper
The worst thing I'd have said was ""no""
So maybe next time
You better push up like a pro, bro

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Saturday, cooling in the house
Looking at the videos
At the same time, I'm trying to put on my clothes
First date! First date!
With a guy, his name was Nate
(Was he fly?) Yes he was
(Word up?) The type you have on a plate, cuzz
I only met him last night
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right
So he rolls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo
What is all this for?
Are we expecting more?
He showered me with gifts and
Then he kissed me on my hand?
Now what was in your plan?
I really didn't understand
We're only going to the movies
Either you're trying to impress me
Or else you're trying to get the cooty
Listen baby, I don't want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from a man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 3:]
Now if you ready to deal
With a girl who considers herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
And chill with the shyness and the pride, baby
Cause life is beautiful with the Highness by your side
Maybe we can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride, listening to music, and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
But you ain't gotta be no superstar, honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money ain't gon' make me love ya
And neither will your car
So cease with the latter two
With that attitude you won't be getting far

And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction? (Yeah)
If you're cool like that
Take a trip to Jersey, cause that's where I'm at

No you ain't gotta be no superstar
I only wanna know just who you are
No you ain't gotta be no superstar

I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in
A female walked up to me and said ""Latifah bust a line""
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time
I said ""If you really want to do this, we can do this, fine
Take six paces and begin to rhyme""
As soon as she attempted to make a sound
I ate her up with the verb, broke her down with the noun
Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings

[Daddy-O]
Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them
Rhyme fiends, biters, and bums
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one
He started, he started to run
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step

You see you may speculate, but everybody knows
Not one amatuer can deal with the pros

Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo

Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line

So feel the flow, y'all, because you're under attack
]From my rhymes, cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks
And four words to the wack, just ""Stay the hell back""
Cause it's a fact if you're wack you ain't saying jack
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide
How you wanna be eaten, boy, baked or fried?

It's Latifah the Queen, pioneer of the mainstream
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound
So button your lips and stop trying to be down
I caught you out there (How many times?) A lot of times
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme
Stepping to the right, to the left
To the best place, well I have to face

Why you wanna make me cry like this?
Why is you wanna make me cry?

Your love is like a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, hard to hold

Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone and it hurts so much

Well then why...
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?

Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think about it being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me, baby
I don't want to live

Well then why...
Oh, why
Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry? [5x]

But it wouldn't go away, just subsided through the haze
Just drifted off into deeper thought
I broke my mind and searched my heart
Finally what was blindin' me was just as clear as day

I figured out what's stressin' me, depressin' me
Mummy that man molesting me, oh no
Was only 5 years old, I couldn't seem to tell a soul
I didn't know how to let you and daddy know

And I can't go on like this
That's the type of thing that'd make you slash you wrists
But now that I realize this happened to me
I've gotta fight this

The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin'
Tryin' to move out is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]?
Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours
Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face

Help me with what happens in the world
Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare

He asked what would make a 14 year old boy wanna take his life?
It'd be the fact that he got a dad who uses him as a punchin' bag
Beats him till he's blue and black and won't stop will he makes him cry

You kept it to yourself and made excuses for the bruises
Took painkillers to kill the pain from a daddy who's abusive
He was telling you, you were useless, never heard the words I love you
Made you feel like you were worthless, he's tryin' to save the trouble

And he can't go on like this
That's the type of thing that'd make you slash you wrists

"Did I make you hot? Tell me

I didn't mean to turn you on (x8)

[Verse 1:]
I can see it in your eyes
You wanna get down with Queen La
Lace Latifah, I can see ya eyes on my body parts
The friendship's slippin' cause it ain't me you hittin'
Why you trippin'?
Wishin' you could get a taste from the black Queen
It captivates the mass when I slide on the scene, yo
We ain't gettin' down like that
You took a hug to the next level, try to spit that
Counterfeit, nice shit put on the act trick
Try to get a quick kiss and you got snapped quick
I tried to be nice and play it all smooth
Well I guess done has somethin' to prove
So I had to move, getaway like a fugitive
Didn't wanna do the kid cause I knew the kid
Didn't really wanna do no harm
I don't know what I did but I didn't mean to turn you on

[Chorus:]
I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice
Let you touch it once or twice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on

[Verse 2:]
All the ladies in the place know how it go
When you show a lil' kindness, cats wanna flow
Want some mo' neck shit, some mo' sex shit
Well, you tell 'em from the door, it's strictly friendship
Didn't mean to turn you on
Why apologize? I ain't do nothin' wrong
You knew what the deal was, what the real was
You was confused with the levels of love
I seen you in the club with your eyes on me
All night lookin' asinine, up under the strobe light
You on thin ice in steel-toed Timbs
When it break through I don't think we could be friends
If you sayin' you a playa, baby, live like one
You play yourself like a bomb, never gettin' none
And say beggin' for some and never get it
If I turned you on, I guess you gotta live with it

[Chorus]

I didn't mean to turn you on (x8)

[Verse 3:]
So what you mad now, got a attitude now
Cause I had to pull your foul?
Frontin' big Willie style when you're a major joke
Pagin' me so much till my pager smoked
Got your Eskimo kiss and shit
Your nose's too brown, how you get chicks to trip
Well I ain't the one, I could buy you and your whip
Hold your head cause I've got so many hits, what?

[Chorus] (3x)",Queen Latifah,Turn You On,

Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 1]
Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah !

[Verse 2]
I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me

What's goin' on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady) ?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth gettin' your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Barking with no bite!)
She got to wear that for life

Resting in your arms
But you've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend

Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that

I know, you know
We are occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
That must be rectified

When we are absent, that is a [?] to present
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But on the weekend, wish the clock would reverse its hand
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together, cause we're spectacular
As if we never miss a second of the hour
When we are together, I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are-a just a...

"[Intro:]
Someone out there is heartbroken, mmmhmm
Someone out there feels all alone
Can't eat, can't sleep, cause you lost someone you really love
But you know what, you gon' get through it
Just pray on it, alright?

[Verse 1:]
Tell me why
(Unfortunate situations you gotta go through)
Situations come and cut you like a knife
(Cause you to be overcome by sadness)
Exposes your smile and turn around
Into a frown and brings you down
(I know it gets to weigh so heavy)
So heavy on your mind
It's gonna take some time
(But sometimes I feel so low)

Oh, sometimes I feel low

[Chorus:]
(What ya gonna do when it happens to you?)
Tell me whatcha gonna do when it happens to you?
What you gonna say when your friends go away
What is there to say when a friend goes away?
(What you gonna do when it happens to you?)
Just pray, just pray, just pray
(All you gotta do is just pray on it)

[Verse 2:]
You're never ready
(When you lose someone you love so [?])
When the person you laughed with, talked with, trusted goes away
(And the loss of love it makes you feel sad)
To that special place that's written in the sky

I can't describe this pain that I am feeling deep inside

Give it all to him

[Spoken Intro:]
This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki
Who's looking down on me from Heaven
Watching my every move as usual

[Chorus:]
There but for the grace of God do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go

[Verse 1:]
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme
But it's busting from the seams
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
Moving all around, oh yes I'm making leaps and bounds
There's so much you can say
No time to write it down
I'm skipping to this and skipping to that
I've overflowed my cup
I'm flowing kinda quick, I hope you can keep up
Everything ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand
There's things about me all of y'all just got to understand
Latifah never was a teacher, never was a preacher
Never was a saint, never was conceited, never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired, sometimes I wanna faint
But I never shut up when things pissed me off
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across
That's what I gotta do
That's how it gotta be
I got an angel watching over me

There but for the grace of God (If you lose your way)

[Ad-libs:]
It's time you find
What's goin' on in your mind
Try to find peace of mind
When your blind, world's unkind
Got to fight, keep the right
At the time, never gone
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Strive on, strive on, strive on
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

"My mellow, Latee, was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""
So I paused and took a thought
Then my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex
Cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying
For somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
I'm coolin', teaching those needing schoolin'
And the mic? This mic in my hand? I'm rulin'!
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

[Chorus:]
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Some MCs act bold and arrogant
Vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity
Cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme that's so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste
But don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do right
And just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well, mine are growing
Yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say
And even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness
Just call me ""Your highness""
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

[Chorus]

Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble
You're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious
The same as the pace
The crowds, they love me
The brothers give only hugs
Their shrink-to-fit button-flies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it
Don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness

[Chorus]

The scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face
You don't want to feel the taste
Don't try to play me out
Cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap
Sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite
Don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip
You're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time
Just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness",Queen Latifah,Wrath of My Madness,
