"[Verse 1]
Hot damn, hot damn, hot damn, hot damn, hot damn
Hot damn ho, here we go again
Suckers steal a beat when you know they can't win
You stole the beat—are you having fun?
Now me and the Aud's gonna show you how it's done
You are what I label as a nerver plucker
You're plucking my nerves you MC sucker
I thought I oughta tell you, better yet warn
That I am like a stock and my word is bond
Like James, killing everybody in sight
The code's three-six, the name is Lyte
After this jam, I really don't give a damn
Cause I'mma run and tell your whole damn clan
That you're a...

[Hook x2]
Beat biter, dope style taker
Tell you to your face you ain't nothing but a faker

[Verse 2]
Hit me why don't ya, hit me why don't ya
Milk's bodyguard is my bodyguard too
You wanna get hurt? Well, this is what you do
You put your left foot up and then your right foot next
Follow instructions, don't lose the context
Thirty days a month your mood is rude
We know the cause of your bloody attitude

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Your style is smooth, even for a cheating mic
You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim sound-alike
Here's a Milkbone, a sign of recognition
Don't turn away, I think you should listen close
Don't boast, you said you wasn't bragging
You fucking liar, you're chasin' a chuckwagon
The only way you learn, you have to be taught
That if a beat is not for sale, then it can't be bought
When you leave the mic, you claim it's smoking
Unlike Rakim, you are a joke
And I think you ought to stop, before you get in too deep
Cause with a sister like Lyte, yo I don't sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
When I'm in a jam, with my homegirl Jill
My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls
So I step in the middle, shake it just a little
Wait for some female to step up and pop junk
Give my cousin a cue, treat the girl like a punk
Now I'm not trying to say that I'm into static
But yo if you cause it, yep, we gotta have it
Cause I ain't going out like a sucker no way
So I sit around the way for you to make my day
We can go for the hands, better yet for the words
Cause you'll be ignored, and at the same time I'll be heard
Throughout the city, the town and the country
The beat is funky, my rhyme is spunky
There is no delaying in the rhyme I'm saying
Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing

So sit back Jack, and listen to this, it's 10% dis
Cause I'm just about ready to fly this fist against your lips

But I'll wait for the day or night that you approach
And I'mma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast
Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble
Your skin just crumble, a battle's no trouble
Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid
This thing called hip-hop, Lyte is ruling it
I hate to laugh in your face, but you're funny
Your beat, your rhyming, your timing, all crummy
On the topic of rapping, I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet
Your rap is weak homegirl, and it's definitely crooked

Others write your rhymes while I write my own
I don't create a character when I'm on the microphone
I am myself, no games to be played
No script to be written, no scene to be made
I am the director, as far as you are concerned
You don't believe me, then you'll have to learn
This ain't as hard as MC Lyte can get
Matter of fact, you ain't seen nothing yet
So never let me step into a party hardy
Talk to some people and then hear from somebody
'You wanna battle?' cause you know where I am
You don't wanna come in the 90's and see me at a jam
When a mic is handy, ten feet away
I stretch my arm like elastic, hand like a magnet
Set assure, you know I don't play
When it comes down to it, the nitty gritty
For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity

[MC Lyte]
I'm too old?  What's with that crap?
Come on now brother, age is just a number
Anyway what matters is your state of mind
And if you give me some time I'll make your heart all mine
I don't like pushin and I don't like rushin
But most of all I don't like fussin
So come on now sweetie why don't ya stop frontin
Besides older folks come equipped for good lovin
Are you really serious?  Age really matters?
I thought telling you this, you would be flattered
Well I guess I was wrong cause you still ain't widdit
.. oh well, forget it, nope nope
But don't you dare touch me, you said you wasn't widdit
You waited too long now, Lyte is not havin it
I coulda showed you things, taught you how to explore
My question is, what are you too young for?
I coulda shown you things that you never seen before
Took you all around on my wild world tour
But you're too young, too young to have fun
.. oh well, I'm done

[MC Lyte]
It may sound nasty and it may sound mean
But I'm into little boys that are about seventeen
I don't know why, but they put up a fight
And hot damn that excites the MC Lyte
Cause yo I love a young buck, that give a firm {fuck}
But once in a while, they become lovestruck
But that's okay though, cause I can handle them
I love young boys on the brink, of being young men
I mold em, shape em, make em then I break em in
They get the job done, I make em get the job done
Well, swell, make em kiss and tell
All of their friends around the neighborhood
That Lyte is GOOD, soul food GOOD
So tell me honey, are you ready to score?
Again I'll ask, what are you too young for?

Last but not least yo here's a description
Hard workin, not one that sells prescription
So if you're in school, that's okay
Get straight A's and I'll be back on Friday
You won't miss me, you know where to find me
And these words I will say finally
Never let age, restrict you from whatcha wanna do
Whether you're young or ninety-two
So if you're seventeen or around that age..
.. baby come to the stage
And if I didn't change your mind I'd find that odd
So when I ask this, think hard..

"I play practical jokes, just to get a laugh (ha hah)
I put roaches in my neighbor's bubblebath
But anyway one day she called upon me
She said, ""Lyte - it's an emergency!""
My next door neighbor had an errand to run
I said, ""Why Ms. Davis - ask your son""
She said, ""Ricky's at his grandmother's""
I said, ""Well what about Tommy, the younger brother?""
She said, ""See, umm, he's at the pharmacy""
I said, ""He'll be back soon how much longer could it be?""
She said, ""C'mon please, it's just a trip uptown
If you leave right now you'll be back before sundown
Hurry up, there's not a moment to spare
It absolutely positively has to get there""
Umm, I contemplated then I played a good Samaritan
I started the car, then she threw the package in

	It absolutely positively has to get there
	(Get there?)
	It absolutely positively has to get there
	(Well then send it Federal Express!)
	It absolutely positively has to get there
	(It gotta get there?)
	It absolutely positively got to get there!
	(Yo who you rushin?)

Pumpin out the music on the FDR
Not far behind me was a DT car
So I eased up selector, 55 the digit
But on the FDR, 40 is the limit
Here they come, sirens on
I could see myself in jail til the break of dawn
But they rolled right by it wasn't me they was after
A little red corvette, they was tryin to capture
Dread I feel sweat so I set down my jacket
Look up ahead, now that's what I call traffic
Dipped to an exit and I made my way through
Couldn't believe when I hit first avenue
On a Honda's ass, just about to crash
Looked at the gauge and the shit said NO GAS
Zero, nada, nothing in here see
In car terms the shit was on empty
Got out, and pushed the shit to the side
Hailed a cab, then I caught a quick ride
To the house of inflation, yes the gas station
Gave a little tip to show my appreciation
Got back to the ave where I left my car
It wasn't there, but it couldn't have gone far
Hot damn, I must have got towed
Tried to figure out how much money I owed
Went to the pound and I paid my debt
Think that was the worst?  You ain't heard nuttin yet
Bumped into that crackhead Sam I used to see
And like always, hand out, give me money
In my tank was a dollar's worth of gas
I had to get an ? machine fast

	It absolutely positively has to get there
	(Get there?)
	It absolutely positively got to get there
	(What?)
	It absolutely positively got to get there
	(Well send it some way else)
	It absolutely positively has to get there

As I left the bank to walk back to the BM
Couldn't believe what my eyes were seein
Looked at the back tire, it was flate
While the other three, were SO DAMN FAT
A brother walked by and offered his help
Ordinarily I woulda did the shit myself
But he, changed it quick, so I passed him a ten
Here I go on this journey again
Went to the gas station, to fill it up
When a crackhead from nowhere grabbed the pump
I said, ""LOOK, I don't need your help today""
And I scared the motherfucker and he was on his way
Oops, a cat, SHIT, scrat!
Fur on my tires, and all that
What's this, a stroke of bad luck?
But at this point, I don't even give a fuck
I got to get the package to the destination
No matter what the confrontation
I arrive, bag in my hand
Lookin for a woman named Pam
She opened the bag it was wrapped tight and snug
But in that bag yo, in that bag
45, guess what?  (What was it Lyte?)
It was a box of q-tips .. a box of fuckin q-tips man!!!

Can't hear nuttin so I turn down the hip-hop
Window down, reggae hit or somethin

Keepin it hard, but still I'm changin it
Breakin all types of grounds
Here comes Wolf and Epic with the new sound
They get the job done
The name of the year is Lyte slash Ninety-One

Waitin for those, that might see in
Straighten my jacket, fix my hair
Turn up the system, as I prepare
To let the whole wide world know
This is my show
Now that I've schooled you and put you up on the scoop
Posse or massive, solo or group
Take it in stride, it's an inside
Top secret heavy duty type of thing that I'm swingin
I got the key to success but I won't press
I'm sure that I can relieve you, of the stress
If you ad-mit, and just per-mit
Me to go for mine and drop a line and ex-it

It was a date, a simple little fuckin date
Or so I thought, wasn't that my great mistake
He picked me up at eight, from my crib
We went to dinner and he ordered babyback ribs
What a waste, a waste of the mind and body
And then he said, ""Lyte, would you like to go and party?""
I thought about it, and then I said, ""NO!
Pay for my food motherfucker and let's go!""
He said, ""My, aren't we agressive..""
Damn right, and I'm also perceptive
I know your kind, you roam around the fuckin town
You wanna slap it, flip it, and rub it down
You want some booty but you're gettin none this way
You better ask Suzy Sally or that girl Fay
You gets NONE, you hear me you cheesy rat?
Because I'm Lyte, and I'm havin NONE of that

Chorus: MC Lyte

I'm all that, yes I'm all that
You ask how?  I'm all that now
I'm all of that, yes I'm all that
And rollin through your hood with a BASEBALL bat

[MC Lyte]
First I head out, into the red-eyed
Turn the AC, so it feels cool inside
Step in the jam, baring good news
Although for some folks, I bring the blues
Always solo, no relyin on a posse
I see what you see, do you see what I see?
I see suckers, many pucker-uppers
ASS-kissers, as well as buttlickers
Many many that will do me good and plenty
Don't know me from Adam, but wanna get with me
Claimin they will do or have done or have did me
Talkin that yang, your ass'll get SLAPPED
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin NONE of that

Back, way back when, shit wasn't funny
I'm talkin L-Q days, your gold and your money
If you wore gold, the shit was gettin taken
Hard rocks, don't even bother fakin
Cause they can sense a sucker as SOON as they saw ya
And oh well, how I felt sorry for the
Razor in my pocket, for my protection
Blackjack in my bag for a little selection
You got beef?  BITCH, chose your weapon
I sliced and diced, and then I kept steppin
For me to go for that woulda just been wack
Because I'm Lyte, and I'm havin NONE of that

"Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

I know you keep them in your heart
That special part. Didn't care to share
Thought he'd always be there
But he had to go. It was his time to fly
Though he struggled to live
See we all gotta die
Don't question why
It's just how life goes
It just happened to be your number one homie that God chose
Your sadness shows, your woes, your sorrows
But keep in mind the sun will shine tomorrow
Now he's gotta halo, an everlasting glow
And it's painful but only God knows
What's next on the agenda (yeah)
Either way you gotta return to sender
But while you're here you gotta keep ya head up
Moving on your life and never let up
Let the past be the inspiration to get up
Tell the devil he's a liar and ya feed up c'mon

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

Release and let go the fault wasn't ours
She was called upon by a much higher power
What's important for us all to understand
We're just little pieces in God's big plan so
Hold on when I tell you hold on, stay strong and it won't be long
Till you see your little boy again your mommy again your brother again
Your best friend
Sometimes you just wanna ball out his name
Seem like your sun don't shine the same, but you gotta maintain
Remain sane, know you're not to blame
But while you're here
You gotta keep your head up
Keep moving on your life and never let up
Let the past be the inspiration to get up
Tell the devil he's a liar and ya feed up c'mon

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

I know it's hard living life after death
Sometimes hard to see what you got left
Now you're feelin' lost don't know what to do
Don't let the demons out there try to fool you
Give it all to God he'll pull you through
Jehovah'll make a witness out of you
You know it's true, but it's hard to realize
That God's still there when your best friend dies
They'll be times when you just fall apart
Just remember to keep them always in your heart
Let the tears fall it's okay to cry
Try to understand it's his time to fly
There's a time when a spirit to say peace and release
From a body that's left deceased
You've got to know there's so much more than what's right here
Have no fear

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

Well I deliver as quick as you call my name
I'm beyond the hype, beyond the fame

That I can shake you groove you and move you too
I am, too much to bear

And all that type of jazz and pizazz
I'm, into, reality
Forget the fantasy, this is me
Beyond the hype, so don't believe
What you read, cause they'll deceive
So now I come to you
Telling no lies, the truth is in my eyes
Unlike the broadcasters on the news
Who try to tell you, the donts and the do's
The media blows things out of proportion
The public's eye, proceed with caution
It's a dog eat dog world
But we'll be alright
All we gots to do is stick together
And move beyond the hype

Chorus 2X (w/ variations)

You, must, trust when I say I'm here to stay
And believe I'll never leave
Haste, makes, waste
The track is all that, so pick up the pace
Forget the rumors, gossip, shit-talk
Besides that's old news, and that can walk
I'm beyond that, you are also
Release the negative vibe and let it go
So now, I come to you
Bearing gifts that certainly uplift
From coast to coast, Midwest I'm the most
But still, not on a high post
I'm comin, just call my name
Beyond the hype, beyond the fame
Down to Earth, I'm just that type
To take you and move beyond the hype

So FUCK the stocks and bonds I'm your new investment
Pick up the album it's quite a refreshment
Compared to the day to day BULLSHIT you hear
Pay attention and listen I'm comin clear to the ear
For all you non-believers, and you perpetrators
That TALK to me now but TALK about me later
It's time for you to grieve, grovel in your sorrow
I'm the star of today AND the star of tomorrow
I'm takin out the old jacks, rippin up the new ones
I don't care if it means I have to ruin
I will and I shall and I get the job completed

Mess with the wrong one, kid, you get ruffed up

I got the rhythm that'll rip up shows
Blow down foes, they kill at will to get a taste of my flow
Vocally I rock locally and worldwide
Those that got bad wish they woulda never tried
Cause when you come from where I come from
You gotta be tough
Cause niggas'll call your bluff quick enough
Cause if your hood is like my hood, you gotta think quick
Shit stink, niggas are slick, have you turnin tricks
I gotta give it up to Mr. Cool J
For givin up the props to the girls around the way
It ain't safe after dark to throw a jam in the park
If you wanna get naughty, bring your forty to the arc
Cause we get down when it comes to a jam
Just watch your backpocket, keep a eye on the man
If your town is like my town, you don't wanna mess around
Wind up gettin bagged up, beat down

Comin hard for your section, slow up
Live in the flesh and about to blow up
So yo, come down, and then get the fuck up
Looks are hooked, you lucked up, you're booked
You gotta be hard, cause I ain't with softies
Hit, then you miss, gotta get offa this

"I got the charm and the wit of a pop hit
But I'm street.. ""Catch the beat""
Don't drop it, just don't stop it
Don't you dare step off the topic
That I got a one-track mind and this track's all mind
The whole three four five six seven eight nine
In the pocket, burstin in the air are rockets
Creatin lots of Lyte -- get it?
How many different ways can I say it?
Piano Man, how many ways can you play it?
I spell it out, the L-Y-T-E
Without a doubt.. ""Got to be funky!""
And it damn sho' nuff is
It gotta be like that, in this rough biz
Of music, baby, use it or lose it
What's funky is funky, you can't refuse it
I got a grip on the groove and it won't move
An inch until I pinch this party

""Can you dig it?""	""Right on""	""Right on!"" (4X)

It's my style, love it, or lump it
It's my beat, pass it or pump it
And it thumps, like a heartbeat
And when it gets old, it won't get weak
It'll get stronger, much stronger
Long live the King, but the Lyte lives longer
It's well argumented and well documented
I hold the title of the best, you can't prevent it
With a ten foot pole, you can't hold em
Born to be wild is what a song once told me
Was my destiny, so I strive to be the best
Lo and behold..
Every rhyme I write, you gots to chant them
Every song I sing, a national anthem
Is there a message in my music?
If I can do it -- you can do it!

""Can you dig it?""	""Right on""	""Right on!"" (8X)

The L, Y, T, E, has to make
""funky funky funky hit records"" Constantly!
So in the advent of an event
I have to invent a dope style comment
I come off with flyin colors
I keep my own identity, compared to no others
It's hard to do, but I pull it through
Cause I'm Lyte the MC, that's what I do
The body snatcher, yo I gots to catch a
MC head up, bring on a batch of
New ones, so I can systematically do em
The old ones, HUH, I already been through em
Two by two, I do em like Noah
Yes you know the time, so let's go
The bottom line, is I'm funk bound

It was a cafe? On
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown

Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, ""Shut the fuck up!""
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind

Death, it was gettin' closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin' over his girl
Another died drivin' while intoxicated
Why do people make livin' so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary

Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin' - or is dead better?

I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin' from a plane
But at this café was death still callin' my name?
Or did this café even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word 'Cappucino'
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin' shit, it'd be workin'
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if every time I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino

Why, oh why? Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino, Cappucino

Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide

Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-Y-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you

Get it if you can, if you cannot get up off the pot
You been missing, pissing up the spot a lot
And I've been waiting on the sideline, give you the guideline
Get up in that pocket like a pocket light, but they don't rock it right
They don't concern me, can't even burn me
Not even with a lighter, all them liars, they ain't worthy
You heard me, I'm a loner: me, myself, and I
I'm a powerhouse, ready to collide with the greatest tide
It's like a typhoon in the making
What I'm saying leave your whole city shaking, broken down, better start praying
I ain't playing, this ain't hopscotch, on the block, or skelly up in den streets
Get jelly whenever we meet
Chic, I'm about my paper; dudes, see ya later
South side of the equator, so hot, gotta thank my maker
I'm here, flow with the best of them, get low with the rest of them
Rang the alarm in '88 and I'm still buzzin'

Get it straight: I'm Lyte as a rock and they featherweight

How you pass like a bullet, speed of Lyte and that Lytro gas
Here I go, there I go, here I go again
I ain't no fad like Michael Jack, they know I'm Bad
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
You from the hood, you understood, and understand just who I am
I live to be free, I live for the beat, I live for the biz
That's what it is, no wondering, I get it in, I get it done
You are the one, but I am the Lyte; without me, you're out of sight
I'm taking this entire game to a new height
Just watch me, just like you do YouTube and Hulu
Lyte is back and all over this map like who knew
Rapping to you; listen because I might not say it again

More potent than a foul vile of crack

Oh you independent now 'coz you bitin' my lines
Listen, two flamin' bitches hide yo' claiming and sixes
Shines so bright can't see us in pictures
Leavin' non believers in ditches
Those who can acchieve won't percieve our existance
They need verbal assistance, check it
All them things you say you got, we now your makin' it up
To get a man in a club, you steady shakin' it up
See thay played my song twice 'coz they can't get enough
I'd say put yourself in my shoes but they cost too much

Am I bad no question they just a fraction
Tryin' to get some action from the section
Ain't that somethin' I got your crew jumpin' and bumpin'
While you talkin' nothing
I bring it to you with no hesitation
'Coz the top is where I rest but it's your destination
And I know this so I'm puttin' you on notice
Don't you come too close to this
I got the gift to forsee the drama like they know me
Pullin' up slowly and tryin' to bring out the ol' me
But I'm brand spank comin' for your bank
Not nigga what you think but what you thought, and now you caught
Long as you live and for eternity
You're only bad as Lyte the MC allows you to be
Not easy to sabbotage wiser than the average
You can jack me now and later you can peep my, catalogue

Know this life has been filled with stress and pain
If I could, I would take it all away

I know you gotta feel like your back is pinned against the wall most times
But in those times, you remain open
Closed minds will get you nowhere
Gotta move with no fare, so dear
I salute you
Knowing everything you've been through is just a journey
Every man must take the key
For some it's not to make the same mistakes
And fall victim to the chaos the world creates
In the heat of the moment
You can mistake an ally for an opponent
And wipe your own out
What a waste, and an evasive hate
You discover that it's too late

Smoke a little weed to keep my mind free
Only God can judge me, so to him I plead
Fifth in my hand, the myth of a man
That I should know it all and I ain't supposed to fall

Writings on the wall, fighting for the cause
Read a letter from the world and it said ""It's yours""

Bus as you gotten older, doors are now closin'
Karma comes around
And all those silly things you did as a grown child are wheelin' down in your direction

Word around is you're the ass in the biz
To let 'em kill your men off you must be soft
Heard they shot up your car and ransacked your loft
Now you need a get away a place to hide, cause your man done snitched on the inside
You was on the run like a slave aback in the days, you must have been nodding when
They said
""Crime don't pay""
I got a new gig, here you come again kid, fresh out the dog
Done did your bid but you can't stay here no more, not in this crib
Not with the foul way that you choose to live...


[Outro]
Motherfucka -- you know what/
Just, just take your shit all right! Just take it!
Cause I'm sick of this shit - I can't take it no more
Just take it, I don't know who the fuck you think you are
Thinking you could just come back here and try to enter my life -- like I need you
I dont -- I'm thru with you motherfucka
Just get out! You put me thru too much heartache
Too much shit
I had to go thru -- I can't do it no more",MC Lyte,Druglord Superstar,Da Brat
"[Hook:]
Every day I need my shit done in a special way everyday

Off the top see me and want to serve
Just thinkin about what they need
Ain't that some nerve, now look here 24 hours and
7 whole days, I demand my respect
I demand my praise, everyday that I wake
I gotta have everything done with no mistakes
I take it incredibly slow don't try to rush me
No means no, I never said a no that meant yes
Other women get taken for granted
I guess I got a wish list that must be fulfilled
And you gets none until I get my toes sucked
And my eyebrows pluked
I need my car waxed and floor shellac
I need my back rubbed and da bubbles in the tub
That float to the bed so that we can make love

[Hook]

It ain't to ask for when
I come off tour to have my truck washed
Or my body massaged, all the bills paid i send home
All my dough and you being my man it just ain't for show
All the lovey dovey yeah that is sweet
But honey bunny you gotta earn your keep

But don't sleep cause I need a lot of shit done
And cold harded yeah check out whatever is clever
And get to stepping if you know somthing better
If not, then respect whatcha got
Meanwhile I got a new ride at the lot
Pick it up and bring it back to the spot
This is how we do it this is how we do it now, everyday
I need it done in a special way baby, tell them how it goes

[Hook]

On the real I need a man that understands me and
Realizes the reality: I'm in the MC industry which means
I want to live lovely I gotta make money
Listen so never ask me to give it less then what I got
If it's too hot nigga, then raise up out my spot
If it's my trade i made up the black ace of spade
Alone in the world it's me you can't fade
It's my life, I do it my way
You don't like my way? Then hit the highway
See I'm special not because I'm MC lyte, but because
I'm a women with the gift to bear life, it's done
Yes I've rested my case now run pick up my dermalogical
For my face this is how it goes down everyday
I need it done in a special way baby

[Hook]",MC Lyte,Everyday,
"[Verse 1]

He knows he's leaving, not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight
Losing sleep, stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
To push in the bush but took his time
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with
Shared needles with
Wish he could go back, change the direction
But now he's got the infection
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words
I'm sure he's heard
Live by the sword, die by the sword
What's left, pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
Because the eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

[Verse 2]

I look into his eyes, but he's so high
From the crack, he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesn't like solving
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving
19, his eyes full of tears
He hasn't smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
Robbed and killed her, because of the crack pipe
He's wanted by the law
Because he's robbed at least three grocery stores
He's lost, all control
Take a look, eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

[Verse 3]

I look into her eyes, she's so young
But I know, where she's comin from
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried, fear in her voice
Not knowing, she had a choice
Oh so sad, oh so lonely
If she knew that she's not the only
One in school that didn't use the caution
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N
To put it to an end
She's learned a lesson I suppose
I can tell, eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..",MC Lyte,Eyes are the Soul,
"Yeah, I heard somebody say fire
Y'all want heat, here go heat, right here
Lyte the MC, Neb Luv, show them what heat's got

Yeah, we spittin' venom in 'em, whether it's men or women
I kill 'em like the ? and dismiss 'em at the minimum
I'm leavin' 'em twisted like a braid, glow like a fade
My lyric cut your spirit like a swiss army switchblade
The more in my cup, the more dangerous
More that I bust, they call me angel dust
I'm heat proof, flip a nigga off their feet
Then creep the streets and ? underneath
The skin off the bone, how I burn a MC
Stop, look and listen, and learn from me
I got that fi-i-i-ire, get lost and pay the cost
Get tossed, that's your only option
You're locked in cause I'm blockin' your oxygen
I'm knockin' your chin, rockin' your noggin
I'm rollin' with Foxx and them
Bitches better quit before Lyte hit, fuck what you thought
Niggas gettin' caught

Heat scorchin', torchin'
Set it off, let it blow often, better use caution
Fi-i-i-ire, get you up in the club and get the drinks tossin'
Yo, fuck ?
Heat scorchin', torchin'
Set it off, let it blow often, better use caution
Fi-i-i-ire, get you up in the club and get the drinks tossin'
Yo, fuck ?

	[Neb Luv]
I breathe through, bleed through
The track, you suckers are see-through
React with a mack, you're fake, I could read through
Like buck, youse a soft crook
But look twisted and catch your heart hook
The street, plus my niggas gotta eat like kings
This chick carry heat supreme
?, sinister, make you a believer
Conniving industry cats be lying, spying
On the sick chick, with them sick hits
No, here's a sick tip, keep this your business
Music addictive, ?, voice
Layin' the cuts in the Royce five four
Flow like C4 through your door
Hit ya open like pores, bang baby get you on the floor
You know how it is when you move till your sore
Nothing but the bubbly, ain't nobody poor

Heat scorchin', torchin'
Set it off, let it blow often, better use caution
Fi-i-i-ire, get you up in the club and get the drinks tossin'
Yo, fuck ?
Heat scorchin', torchin'
Set it off, let it blow often, better use caution
Fi-i-i-ire, get you up in the club and get the drinks tossin'
Yo, fuck ?

Burnin' MC's at 99.9 degrees
With flows like these I keep 'em on they knees
Torturin', they sit motionless
After they feel the dust they can't get with us
I'm razor sharp, comin' for your main artery
It ain't hard for me, it ain't hard to see this
Fi-i-i-ire

	[Neb Luv]
Blaze like inferno, injure internal
Damn right, Neb and Lyte crew will hurt you
Suffocate the body like heat wave we'll work you
Till you're purple, till you feel the pain
I'm a shine, keep it live, baby feel the flame

From top to bottom, cut 'em, gutter, we got 'em
Do 'em like the ?, leave the rest for rock and I swear
It ain't no calm for us in here, we got the fi-i-i-ire nigga

"[Chorus (2x):]
[Big V]
Fuck that motherfucking bullshit
[MC Lyte]
Kiss my motherfucking ass

[Verse 1: Big V]
People call me Strokes, a.k.a. you know the Iceman
When it comes to sex, you know my motto yes I can, can
Never will I front, pass it up or let it walk by
And if I don't get that ass, well at least I did try
I know the games p.m.s. must run through you
You set it up so no man will ever do you
But when you need your weave done, honey read my lips
You can beg all you want but you gets jack shit
I don't play, I work hard for my money
5, 6, 7 days a week, shit ain't funny
Now if sex is old fashioned and you're not selling out
If you're giving it up, you better spit that gum out

[Chorus (2x)]

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
You wanna what? You must be bugging
A minute and a half of having sex, that ain't loving
You couldn't please me if you had his dick
That meaning you heard means you were making me sick
So don't front and lie like you were all that in bed
When I rolled your fat ass over you were nervous and scared
Mr. love man, you ain't shit
You better get your homies to suck your own dick

[Chorus (2x)]

[Verse 3: Big V]
When it comes to sex you get mo better
'Cause I was on your shit even when you had the jetta
It's '93 now and all that shit done passed
So stop frontin' miss 'cause I want that ass

[Verse 3: MC Lyte]
What you what you can't get so step off
There's no room
You want a zoom zoom?
Not in this poom poom
So let me tell you something Mr. Why-you-can't-quit
Save what you can do 'cause that's some bullshit
So go and tell your friends, you know, the ones you got gassed
To take a cold shower 'cause you get no ass

[Chorus (2x)]",MC Lyte,Fuck That Motherfucking Bullshit,Big V
"[Intro: various samples]
Uhh {Yeah, yeah...}
""Funky song"" {ha, ha}
""Cause ain't nothin goin on, but a funky song""
Yes yes yes

K-Rocks is gonna rock, I mean go get hype
So you people all aboard and Lyte has the light
Fresh this dope, promise this too strong
And yo, you can't go wrong with a funky song

[samples]

I don't know the reason
For which that I've become fanatic
For some bass drums and a few hi-hats
But yo please, don't say microphone
Cause I'll be forced to kick whoever thinks they king off they throne
But yo people talk speakers, and sneakers if you wanna
Yeah I like the cars that go boom, I won't front, yup!
Annnd people talkin woofers and the tweeters
I like to go above ten on the volume cause yo it's
Just, a touch, or bass (""a little bit, a little bit"")
Now check the rhythm the rhyme, yeah it fits
It steals your mind like a needle
And then holds on to it like a hostage
And amazement is shown on ALL your faces
To what MC Lyte has given

[samples]

Yo~! I'm definitely proud to say
Those that never heard the tunes well, it's time to vic
So cough up your dollars, put your money where your mouth is
And we can surely as hell get down to business
Don't ever doubt me or what I'm capable of
I have to show and prove that I am a thug
Or should I say the ultimate, yeah that's perfect
Cause I'm as ultimate as money can get
So get the ghetto blaster, boombox, whatever you call it
Grab it by the handle and start to haul it
If you're chillin in your car, open up your back windows
Turn the volume up and let the sounds flow
Or pop a tape in your Benzi box
And drive ten miles per hour through every block
So they can hear the hip-hop, pumpin in the ride
And when you're finished press auto-reverse and play the other side

[samples]

When you're talkin to my deejay, a talk a crossfader
His organized Technics'll leave a flavor later
Cause just like a basshead CHIN, crack greater
And try his hits like ""Yo this sure tastes""
I'm in high pursuit, hope I don't have to shoot
Get down or sit down with all of you
So when you call on my deejay, a call him K-Rock
And when you thought you heard it all here comes the shock
My rhymes, hotter than a danger lie
It's just like that, don't ask why
But I'm cool, cooler than the rocks on a mountaintop
Cause yo Lyte lift the party up further yup
And if you're comin to the jam, yo it's like a hijack
Once you step in, there's no turnin back
It's hypnotism, done every time
You're stickin out your tongue to get a taste of the rhyme
And just like I planned it, satisfies your tastebuds
It's silky and milky, cause your mouth to flood all over you
Dribble and drool you still remain cool
Cause that's what I'm like, rap is made to do
But anyway, since I don't think my job is complete
Say goodnight 'til the next time we meet

[samples]",MC Lyte,Funky Song,
"Make it last long, uha, uh

Here's a situation, skip the talk
Let me know dog if you bite or bark
What it is soldier, you ready to march
Can you make me shoot, or you just soft
Cause I got no time for the games
Just keep my spine full of pain
Hit the boost and hit turbo
In this sexual inferno
Keep my lovin', drippin' drains
Or love highway, switchin' lanes
Show me different thangs with the whip and chains
Hit you with this grippin' pain
Can you handle that, are you alright
Test me out, is it alright
Come on baby, you ain't finished
You servin' time, I ain't talkin' minutes

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Certified misses, I'm misses
Only get my time if it's
Somethin' that stay somethin'
All night, until brunch and
Hit it right, manouvre me
Take your big knot, ? me
Pull my hair back, who the ruler be
Lovin' you so tight, no room for three
Tell me you want me
My love keep you horny
I know's my mother on me
Stay away from the masculine
Thing that keep me needing asperin
Got me gaspin' in for air, pashin' and
Sheets satin and mixed with silk
Here's my love, mixed with milk

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
What does it feel like

Check me out, feminine engine
Brooklyn girl, read the emblem
Him, them, and that's hangin'
Ten, it's nine-eight and then
Till it's hot and you got me bent
On top of my thing, you win
Came nine times, going for the tenth
Think you could hang if you attempt
With energy, when you enter me, hold on
Goin' for a ride, hope you don't fold on
Me, when we in the midst
Of battlin' with my slip
No babblin', close your lips
Get close to it, nothing close to this
Feelin' what I feel when I'm next to you
I stretch for you, please stretch me too
Night got me right as we take the flight
Through the clouds of love, highest heights
My thing's tighter than a Jew's pockets
Think you used to it, go head, rock it

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong",MC Lyte,Give Me What I Want,
"Yeah, God said Lyte from the beginning of time
I'm giving 'em rhymes of feminine kind, keeping it tight
Knockin' the edge off they shoulder
Colder than any MC, and hotter than the next
Check the text
To the left a seagull lights the truth
Kick it to the youth, pocket full of proof
Ready to raise the roof, off the vocal booth
Put hoes back on the track cause they loose
No one a never come there
I have 'em going quicker than city of angels left the air last year
Don't y'all know I scorch MC's
Leave them all toast from the neck to the knees
It's remarkable as I spark a few
Of these rhymes, some rappers find it hard to do
Goldie of the game, everything bout to change
You gettin' stripped for ya shit, niggas thought you knew

I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein' taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me
And if you're wonderin' who could the best be
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac
In full effect MC Lyte is back

Lyte and Maad Phunk, we flamin' on
And took a vacation, some of them came and gone
When I push beef it's like flaming y'all
Tender as I serve these loose rappin' broads
She sellin' straight up sex, by the sea shore
We bang beats from boogie down to BK, New York
I sport the finest of wears, your highness is here
End your rhyming career
I spits it like you wanna do but can't
Your skills iffy cause you tryna dance
Due to the circumstance, get your hands up high
You know the routine, freeze 'em like a drive-by
You know when I roll through I'm reppin' old school
Thought I told you, here let me show you, I don't know you
Fuck you, I don't owe you nothin'
Paper thin, Georgie, had 'em wildin' somethin'

I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein' taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me
And if you're wonderin' who could the best be
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac
In full effect MC Lyte is back

None of these broads wanna get on a track with me
Except for Digga and B, they got balls, as for the rest of y'all
You ain't for me you against me
Means I'm coming for your stacks relentlessly
You see they speak on a passin', Lyte was a lesson
I'm still shakin' these hoes down, without a weapon
Got you guessin' why won't this bitch ever die
Sure as you get high, we'll never see eye-to-eye
I'm the Lytro and I might go psycho
If I'm on my psycho, act like you might know
Which way the light go, but you never will
Cause I never spill, fuck it I said it, I'm that ill
I keeps a tight lip bout what the light hits
I'm get excited bout what I'm gon' get
They mad in the studio catchin' the blues
Why, cause they still can't fill my shoes

I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'

Who it be, me less the crew
Why you talkin that whoopied doo whoo
I'm makin moves, that's smoother than
The cream or the sweat from a wet dream
Drippin wit Vaseline
My Mabeline left a ring on the scene
I got mad peeps down with the tag team
Listen you couldn't front it you want to
Trying to escape now I'm the one that you're running to
Looking at my tag it's about that time
For you to get yours, for me to get mine
I got our shit poppin wheelies like a Ninja
The inner of my center, keeps you warm in the winter
My placenta is on high overload, my complete context
Can get so complex, I might explode
On the scene, like a nuclear bomb
While the children scream, I'm yelling: ""Ring the alarm""

Feel the pressure, coming
Straight off Elektra, the shit that be
Kicking is off the wall crazy

Speak it like I see it
It's the spirit, I ain't go to see it to believe it

Here I come, like a hurricane, ready to
Be reborn, let me be the first to welcome

Examine the style used in this sequence
The rhyme's the clue, the record's evidence
To the fact that I'm hypin this episode
Cold carryin the extra wide load
The beat is fat and the rhyme is thick
All over the town you hear the sound and pick
Me, the L the y the t the e
Me, and if you see the Rock, I'm sure you'll see
Me (Hey Lyte, what will you be doin?)
Kickin it, bashin down competition
And when I drop the bomb, you'll listen
Boom! Now that I've got your attention
I'm slammin what you wanna hear
I just thought that I should mention
'89 is the Lyte year
Now's the time to roll like a rhinoceros
Step to Lyte, that's preposterous
I'm heavyweight, though I'm lightweight
My looks the hook, my rhymes the bait
And when I throw the line you proceed to take
The goody, the treat that I hand you
That you couldn't refuse
Damn, I cram to understand you
Your love is to Lyte to lose

[ VERSE 2 ]
I think you deserve this, you waited long enough
For a rhyme that's super-duper extra tough
Every human is lurkin and loomin
Puba on the beat and you know the shit is boomin
Tasty like pastry, fresh from the bakery
First Priority, that's the way it has to be
Feel the drum, I bet it makes your body numb
One for all, and all for one I bet you come
Hurry, hurry, step right up and see the show
MC Lyte and K-Rock are about to throw
Get on line and purchase your ticket
(Hey, don't worry) Lyte is gonna kick it
(Go on, be happy) I put you up on the scoop
Now come and watch the party hoop

[ VERSE 3 ]
I am the Lyte, and it is time for me to go
You wanna beef, save that shit for the toilet bowl
I use styles, styles and much many styles
I leave smiles, smiles and much many smiles
On the people who come to see the Lyte perform
(Word is bond)
The rhyme will kick as the brain will tick
You can tell because the record'll sell
Old styles and new styles formatted together
Bold or dull, so it doesn't matter whether
Which comes first or vice-a versa
It won't make a difference, as long as you rehearse-a
Get it down pat, and come right and exact
MC Lyte is comin right and I'ma say goodnight

Yeah

I am woman, hear me roar
When I grab the mic it's never a bore
When I'm on stage, sayin' a rhyme
I often wonder what ya think of mine
Is it fresh or weak, or is it live or dead?
Yo, it's got ta be somethin' if you're boppin' your head
To the beat, can I get an amen brother?
Liked that rhyme? Well here goes another...

[Hold up, hold up, hold up. Check it out. Before we go any further we
Gotta announce who we are. I am DJ K-Rock and this is my homegirl, MC
Lyte. Kick it for 'em!]

We had to pause for station identification
Now ya know my name here's some more information
Well, let's see, what you wanna know about me?
MC L-Y-T-E
[The Queen] Nah, that's too corny
[The Sexy] Nah, that gets the guys too horny
[The Best] Now that sounds conceited
But what is true is true, so it has to be repeated
The best is Lyte, when I'm on the mic
And MC's look straight ahead cos this pitch'll make your neck tired
And I say loosen up and relax
The fiction you been livin' I'mma fill with facts
Right now...

[MC Lyte, DJ K-Rock. Name of the group is Me and My DJ. Kickin' it
Live in '88. Do it.]

[Verse 3]
I am woman, hear me roar
Comin' out fresher and flyer than I did before
That's right, I'm well respected
Don't get stupid, I'm well protected
If ya wanna battle I'm well prepared
Me and K-Rock are far from scared, you know what
We're brave, livin' in a cave of gold
Waitin' for the misbehaved to get bold
But as I look around so far so good
MC's behaving just like they should
Hands are folded, no whispering or passing notes
All attention to me ya have to devote
I'm like a teacher, but then again not quite
Cos a teacher's salary I make in a night
On the mic rhymes witty and bright
Maybe that's why the name is Lyte
Yo, bust it, I'mma end it right here
DJ K-Rock, you end it over there",MC Lyte,I Am Woman,

I wish I had an ice cream that looked just like you
Sweet tasting chocolate all the way through
I'd lick you slow from head to toe…

My ice cream, mmm-hmm
Yeah, my ice cream dream
Just the way I like it

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
Sweet dreams, from this don't wake me
You couldn't even if you tried to shake me
What do ya want ‘cause I’m in a deep sleep
No nightmare here, dear, I’m talking chocolate treat
Slick and slippery, thick it’s gotta be
It’s mandatory that I make him a part of me
I'll make the dream last ‘cause it seems
I can only have him, in my ice cream dream

Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a... (Yeah)

Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting (My ice cream dream)

Sweet as candy, a physique for show
I’ma let him know we can go toe for toe
Hip to hip, lip to lip, and then lock it
Big fat feet means big fat pockets
Trick or treat, tasty like pastry
Hmm, I wonder has he had any lately
Ready to hit it if you know what I mean
‘Cause homie seems to be like an ice cream dream

Dark, handsome, six feet tall
31 flavors, I believe he’s got ‘em all
Slippin’ and slidin’ and oozin’ down the cone
Hope he doesn’t melt before I get him home
Drip drop, come on, feed me, Seymour
Take some now, I know later there’ll be more
We got the best, it seems you’re the king
You’re the man in the picture of my ice cream dream

Smooth and rich, he’s looking real nice
Cool as ice, but then again, not quite

He could scoop me up twice ‘cause he’s all that
So I’ma ease up, no time to waste
Forget the chase, I’m prepared to get a taste

Too much to eat so I guess I’ll…bite it

"[ VERSE 1 ]
I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I don't know why, cause he had the head like that of a clam
But you couldn't tell me nothin, cause Sam was number one
Cause to me, oh my gosh, he was one in a million
I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That he'd use me for my money, and then break my heart
But like a fool in love I fell for his game
But I got mine, so I show no shame
In Empire winked his eye, and then he kept walkin
And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin
The roller disco where we all used to go
Just to have some fun back in 1981
You know the place, Empire Boulevard
Is where I first saw the nigga, and he tried to play hard
But I knew the deal, cause I knew his brother Jerry
And Sam, he just broke up with his girlfriend Terry
So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night
He said, ""Hello, my name is Sam"" I said, ""Hi, my name is Lyte""
We dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat
About this and that, from sneakers to hats
He said, ""Look, I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
(Let's go) To my house, lay back and get nice
Watch television, Riunite On Ice""
I said, ""Slow down, I know you wanna shake me down
But I'm not one of the girls to go rippin around""

Ju-just like a test

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next month I finally went to his house
I walked into the door, there was a girl on the couch
I said, ""Who's the frog, the bump on the log?
You chump, you punk, how could you do me wrong?
Singing sad songs about your love is so strong""
You said, ""Wait Lyte, you're confused, the girl is my cousin""
Your brother agreed, but later she said that she wasn't

(Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Forgotten, next month we went to the Deuce
Well, I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice
You knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Asked ya how you met em, said you met em at a party
Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff
I said, ""It's not your business, so shut the fuck up""
They said, ""Okay Lyte, think what you wanna think
But it's gon' be some shit when your man becomes a fiend""
I said, ""Look, to bust a move, I don't even know you
To put it Lyte, I really don't care to""
They kinda got mad and sort of offended
They said, ""We only lookin out for yo best interest""
I said, ""Thanks but no thanks"" in an aggravated tone
""When I wanna find out, I find out on my own""

(Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test

[ VERSE 4 ]
Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C
Well I'm clawin my thoughts, I wonder who she could be
You're spending all your time with her and not a second with me
They say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day
Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K
I strain my brain lookin for a name to fit this spellin
But I just couldn't do it cause my heart kept yellin
Burning, begging for affection from you, Sam
But just like a test I cram to understand you
Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man
But (Just like a test
Ju-just like a test

[ VERSE 5 ]
Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
I asked you why, you said, ""Exercise, tryina stay slim""
I bought it, even though I knew it was a lie
Cause it really didn't matter, you were still lookin fly
But oh no, oh no, you started askin me for money
Butter me up, beg me and call me your honey
So I gave you 2 yards, and then I gave you one more
You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
You came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10
I said, ""I only got a 20"", you said, ""Give me that, then""
I said, ""Nope, I'll tell you now, you better stop slobbin
Find you a job, or you better start robbin""
So I stepped off with a giant step
Picked up my belongings, and I just left
And now I see you in Empire every Sunday
Juicin the girls up for some money and a lay
But every time I see you doin it, I just ruin it
Tell em how ya on crack, smoke, sniff, and chewin it
And as for this girl, Miss C, oh well
I was shocked as hell when I heard, Samuel
When your homeboys told me, I almost went wack

Yeah! This is Lyte coming at you. Shouting out to everybody in the hood.. up to no good. The ruffneck got it going on! Yeah and i'ma do it like this

[Verse 1]
Now kick it!
You flap your tongue and talk about this and that
But all of that wrong rap is real whack
I'm on a roll of my own, you can't play me
So when you talk about the Lyte, get it right, baby
Because I think I'm all that, making niggas call back
They hit the cat and I refuse to call 'em back
It ain't worth it for the moment or the minute
You was in it then you want it but, no, now ya done, kid
I'm only taking shorts if it means I'm wearing 'em
Some of these guys, yo, I'm only scared of them
They can't handle what I got to give and always will
I'm not the run of the mill
I got skills I go on and on as ya boy, K Born!
But I had to kick 'em out before the dawn turn 'em on

[Hook]
I go on and on and on and on
Let it flow, ya don't stop
I go on and on and on and on
Let it flow or ya don't stop!

[Verse 2]
A night owl on the prowl, here's a victim
Soon as I spot 'em bu duh duh, duh duh stick em
Now I got 'em where I want him
And he's all mine, no crime but now he's on prime time
We hit the door, did the booty in the slow mo'
I like to spank 'em, gave 'em bacon on the down low
But that's all, that's it, see ya later, hops
I gave ya props but I'm gonna drop ya at the bus stop
'Cause you was on it like a hornet dog on it
Got me heated then ya beat it now you know just how to treat it
You kinda slow tho when it comes to brain cells
But you can go 'cause I came and I did it well
Sorry to hurt ya but honey, I'm a real one
You got to go if you ain't the funky feel one
And when I'm out it I hope that ya not torn
Because my brother life goes on

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Now let's swing back on the topic
Brothers wanna pop it, knock it and lock it
I'm not having it 'cause I control my destiny
I'm never letting a punk get the best of me
So ease up if yo, you on a jealous tip
I'm not about to be the victim in the news clip
'Cause unlike some girls I fight back
Or get the boys double up and do a head crack
I only here for the righten night
To be hit not smack not slapped or kicked
So if you coming my way you gotta be strong
Strong enough to know that hitting a women is wrong
'Cause just like you, I can find others
Too brothers that do the do quicker than you
So if you looking for a straight up relationship
Keep looking 'cause I ain't staying kid
Because I'm outta and I hope that ya not torn
But never give up 'cause life goes on

Better wish for your own and get out my business

You lived closer, but then you moved
But that couldn't stop our groove
My magic-man, my Brooklyn-boy wonder
I rub your shoulders if pressure you was under
Late night rides out to Sunrise
Catch a flick or two and then back to Bed-Stuy
You in the bubble goose, me in the sheep skin
Cold as hell back then it wasn't mattering
Long as we were hand in hand your my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world

So tonight Baby I'm giving you what you want
It's all yours

Our love is like a Romeo and Juliet flick
So surreal but yet picturesque
There were problems I can admit
But we handled it and still the candles lit
So glad that we didn't just jet
Cause now we reaping the benefits
Who would have thought?
The cute little boy from down the street
Would fall in love with me
It's like a number one dream come true
To have somebody you love, love you
And that's all that matters
Is that we grow together make sure we never shatter
You're the reason I live
Because I want you to get all that I got to give
Long as we're hand in hand you're my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world

Our love is mystical like galaxies you can't touch
Around the world and back again I love you that much
Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde
We'll die of old age side by side
Throughout the days I remain truthful
I keep it tight for you sexy and youthful
I told my mom when our days are through
If you have to go first bury me next to you
What I feel is unexplainable, 'I love you'
Just ain't enough to say to you
You've been there from the beginning to the end

Young and black, that ain't no mystery
But inside runs deep like an ocean
You couldn't understand if I spoke in slow motion
I'm tryin like hell to get some results
But you can bet your ass that it's difficult
They try to keep it down, because I talk to a beat
In other words, because I try to TEACH
But if I talk that yang-yang shit
Like ""U Can't Touch This,"" that shit'll hit
Don't we have any morals anymore?
Or did rap take the toll out the fuckin door?
Well if it did, hardcore's back to claim it
I'ma take it, change it, FUCK IT, rename it
I got the plan, now let's make it effective
You hip-hoppers you GOT to be selective
And stop lettin that BULLSHIT slide for rap
Can't you see that it's a brainwash.. trap?
I rap a Cha Cha Cha, and I sat and watched
You liked that shit, you rock around the fuckin clock
But when I talk of education, you fear that
Drugs and such, you don't wanna hear that
First I pleased you, now I teach you
DON'T YOU DARE try to bite the hand that'll lead you
To the pot of gold, over the rainbow
Lyte'll guide you, I know the way to go
So just close your eyes and just take my hand
Remember MC Lyte has the master plan
We can go THICK, in a posse
You ain't said nuttin slick, I'm goin kamikaze

..

Inside of me, you try to picture me
Can you detect, can you see I'm angry?
Well usually Lyte don't get upset
But when I see wack shit gettin pressed I get VEXED
Turn on the video -- what's this mess?
A disgrace to rap and I'm not impressed
So just leave, get out my domain
You lame sucker, you fuckin no-name
Takin up my airtime, with that
WEAK WHACK FULL OF FULL OF BULLSHIT RHYME
So step off ROACH, or get stepped upon
Because my rhymes they spray like D-Con 4
Do you want more?
Cause I floor.. ANY emcee
That wanna gets with me
So yo, pack your bags, and skedaddle
Just walk, cause you don't wanna battle
I got the button that'll get rid of wack emcees
It's called the Brooklynizer, have you beggin on your knees
So quit takin up space on the CD rack
You better prepare, cause Lyte gives no slack
Inside of me, dwells a hundred maniacs
Waitin for the kickoff, waitin for attack
Who gives a FUCK??  Bring your posse!
Cause in the 90's, Lyte is goin kamikaze

..

Inside -- there's no flipside
Outside there's more than meets the eye
So now you know, not because you're guessin
But because I told you so, I never fess
Everyone wants to rap, what's this a wagon?
Bring your band and hop and start draggin
All you rappers, you're fuckin impersonators
Sayin I'll rap now, and learn how to rap later
No time for that, time is too short
And the rappin gift it can not be bought
A solo artist - HAH, you can't be
Maybe you'll look BETTER with a posse
But all that you're talkin, you ain't sayin shit!
So why you where you at?  I think you oughta quit
Posses don't MATTER in the 90's

Who's body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

[Hook]
Keep on, keeping on cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new, keep on keep keeping on
Doin it right, right, right

[Verse 2]
Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
I guess I can, can I why not
If I wanna guess I can, can I
More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I procede to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

[Hook]

Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me, hurt me then dessert me
You better work me while you got the oppurtunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game

"[Chorus]
Only God knows how we'll all end up
Get so corrupt, we can't give up, we got to keep on pushing
(Keep on pushing, ain't no stopping us)
Ain't no stopping us

A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the righteous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot

Where do I go from here, I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my past, the life I knew, the life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled over seas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concock the scheme
To play upon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears
So ah, where do I go from here, I don't know
I don't know, till I find my past, the life I knew
(The life I knew) the life I knew

[Chorus: x2]
All in the game a young female, so intelligent
And deep like seashells, uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt
Plus interact with the black folks
And blowin' smoke ain't never been a problem
It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster, you know
Let you boost like I'm suppose ta

When a girl walked up with a chrome microphone
She said, ""Hey, MC Lyte, I heard about you
So here's the microphone, let's see what you can do""
So I took the microphone and I threw it to the ground
Cause I need no assist when it comes to gettin' down
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She knew to confront me was truly a mistake
So she picked the microphone off the grey concrete
And before I turned around, she was down the street

"I knew a girl that couldn’t tell time without a digital clock
She was out on the block slinging rocks
In pursuits of the cream cheese papers
Smoked mad lace and she swung many capers
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents
But before she made a twenty, ten cent got spent
She smokin’ but bad times got good
When she met an OG from the neighborhood
Now all is well, though her life is a living hell
She doesn’t know it, ‘cause her pockets don’t show it
Her nigga complies with all of her wishes
She feels like a queen but looks like a fiend
Know what I mean
She couldn’t get her lips off the pipe not yet
And it won’t last long, wanna make a bet

[Chorus:]
She smokin’ that rock, sellin’ that rock
Smokin’ and sniffin’ and sellin’ that rock
Smokin’ that rock
There is none higher, higher

I knew a nigga had a car and some weed
He figured this was the only way that he could succeed
He proceed to let the greed prevail
Not long ago he made his very first crack sale
Now he’s large and in charge
He got four, five, six, six, six cars in the garage
It doesn’t matter how he got it
Long as his keys stay heavy and his pockets stay knotted
Whath he didn’t know is he would meet a hoe
Who would smoke sun to sun
I call her verse one
She get that nigga for everything he got
‘Cause she snippin’ that and he’s sellin’ that

[Chorus]

He met her around the way
Smoothe as oil of Olay
He didn’t know what to say
Eventually they would lay
She wanted a hit and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout no smack on the ass
I tried to tell her that the high won’t last
She wouldn’t listen, mind over matter
But her world was shattered
So the matter ruled over her mind
Every time she’s trippin’ ain’t a figure of speech
She be trippin’ every day of the week
Not only does he want in now he wants to be down
So he snippin’ blow too now",MC Lyte,King of Rock,

Is it a crime - because it's my time to bust a rhyme
A dope line to make the crowd behind me climb
And then twine to a tune that Milk produced
To make the party people get loose
On the dancefloor, so don't try to hide
Cause I designed the rhyme that make your back-bone slide
To the music, cause it's uplifting
Some may try, but they can't get with this
But it's nothing for y'all to compete with
It's just some smooth shit that's legit
To make you get up when you're at a party
And move.. your.. sexy.. body
Up, down, side to side, around
Come one, come all, come see what we found
A way for y'all to work out y'all frustrations
And groove with the band.. K-Rock's the Man

To my sideshow, and watch how my rhymes flow
I let my galant talent illuminate
So give three cheers for, K-Rock the Great
Don't debate, the votes are castin
This is one race that I could never come last in
Boy you know that the K don't play
You can't step to me, don't sleep on a DJ

And rock the sock into a state of shock
That's how it's supposed to be

"Fifteen years old, thought I was in love
I was never told, sex is like drugs
Too much'll drive you crazy -- in fact
The brother was so good, had me comin back
Took my virginity, like he took my heart
I had to find the Lyte, he left me in the dark
All alone, no one to be with
And the brothers they ask me why I riff
I got hard, grew a shell upon my back
I had to get a grip, to keep my life intact
I had to let em know, Lyte is not fragile
Cause if they think this, brothers can get - foul
They'll use, bruise and abuse
Dump your ass and be sure to choose
The next fresh fish that steps into the place
If they desire, they forgot your face
Lovin them and leavin them, that was their reasonin
Thinkin he was pleasin you, when he was just TEASIN you
Summer was over, back in school
He said come over, that would be cool
I said OK, it's been a year now
Some even asked why, some even asked how
Could you wait that long, for me to be with it
Some said yo Hobbes, you're never gonna get it
But then the time came, you and I both came
Things would soon change, never would they be the same
Before this afternoon, took place
I was in love, I walked around in space
I'd rush home from school just to speak to you
Talk for an hour, maybe even two
We'd just laugh though, nothing serious
I guess back then, you were just curious
To see what I was like, just to touch my flesh
I could be wrong though, that's my first guess

..

You was in your house, I was in mine
As long as we were chattin on the line, it was fine
All alone, yet talkin on the phone
If you got bored you felt your bone
And as bad as I am, I talked you through every stroke --
Lyte ain't no joke!
You've been beggin for some time, for me to come visit
You never got mad though, if I wasn't widdit
But this day was different, I was feelin in the mood
For some slow type of groove or some soul food
In other words sex, yeah that's better
I threw on the Jordache, the Izog sweater
That was in style then, come on don't laugh
Sergio's, Lee's, you wore those in the past
Anyway I arrived, twenty past five
He'd been hypin himself, sayin he was quite live
I said here's your chance, show me some romance
We begin to slow dance, off with his pants
BOOM it was over, damn that was quick
Too bad little homey had a widdle widdle *HORN*
The only one I've seen, cause yo he was the first
But since I've had others, damn he was the worst
I was in love though, that didn't matter
Nothin you could say, could ever shatter
My world, take it away, just a young little girl
Oh well
He stepped, jet, family moved
Leavin me in the mood for some soul food
Damn I felt hurt, just like a jerk
Would somebody PLEASE just mush my face in dirt
So I can hide, from the whole fuckin world
WHAT THE FUCK IS LOVE, such a naive girl!
Suppose I got pregnant, damn I'd be lost
My mom woulda kicked me out to live with Jack Frost
I guess I'm lucky though, lonely for sure
Waitin for the fucker to come knockin at my door
I didn't hold my breath though, I might be dead

"Lola hopped into a cab, she went to work
As she walked into the club, the fellas went bezerk
They screamed her name out -- Lola, Lola
Yeah, she was the star of the Copa
She smiled and danced til morning
Lola took uppers, to stop her from yawning
For the finale, she got an applause
Lola was gracious, she didn't do tours
She felt appreciated, just like a star
But for the meanwhile, she got a drink from the bar
Lola had no kids and lost her mother
Her lover used drugs and left her for another
But little did she know that she would make love tonight
She'd do it willingly without puttin up a fight

	Lola.. she was a showgirl..
	with yellow ribbons in her hair..
	and a dress right up to here..

At the bar, his name was Zeke the Freak
He just moved in down the street
He introduced himself and bought her a drink
Before she could refuse, she didn't stop to think
More and more alcohol, now she was intoxicated
He picked her up off her feet, as he escapaded
Down the block then he opened the door
As he struggled to get in, then put her on the floor
He went to the door to make sure that it was locked
As he bolted all of them, he looked up at the clock
It said one, or maybe he'd be done in two
Or two and three, eventually, how freaky could he be?
He began to think what should I do firstly?
I'll get a little drink, because I'm very thirsty
He got a little OJ, to make it really OK
Grabbed a wad of Hubba Bubba, but didn't use a rubber
They did it for three hours, he jumped into the shower
Got out and towel dried, and screamed, ""I've got the power!""
He came out of the bathroom, she was still on the floor
He said, ""Heck I've got to wreck,"" then he jumped on for more

	Lola.. (uh-huh) she was a showgirl..
	with yellow ribbons in her hair..
	and a dress right up to here..
	She met this guy named Zeke..
	who was truly a freak..
	And she didn't stop to think..
	before she took that sunrise drink..

She finally awoke, eight o'clock in the morning
Not remembering a stroke, as she began yawning
Zeke the Freak thought he was thick and slick
But what Zeke did not know
Is that little Lola, little Lola
From the Copa used to be a hoe
Now he's paid, thought he had it made
But Zeke the Freak got AIDS

	Lola.. she was a showgirl.. (yeah)
	with yellow ribbons in her hair..
	and a dress right up to here..
	She met this guy named Zeke..
	who was truly a freak..
	And she didn't stop to think..
	before she took that sunrise drink..
	He caught a bad one..
	while he was havin fun..
	Took Lola to his bed

It's explaining, how heavy the young lady is

I am the talker, you're just the listener
Talk and I'll ignore you, is it that offensive to you?
The problem is you can't understand
The logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you
Merely step aside, what all, call the weak
But you'll also step aside when I'm, comin down the street
You'll give me lots of room, to whistle and walk
And then everything is silent just in case I wanna talk
But I, I never do, small talk I like to hear

Brings back memories of the things that I did
Played jokes on suckers, just for fun
But now I'm much older, those days are done
Everything is business, forget about games

Holdin’ packs in their socks, goin’ get this money non-stop
Fuck the cops, we get the drop
Rather run than get locked
Constantly switching the spots
Navigating nautical yachts
Flooded diamonds seasons
Femme Fatale rhyme and reason
Body time for treason
Air Force One, we leavin’
Panama Red holdin’ 52 heads for ransom
My nigga Johnny Handsome trigger itchin’ to cancel ‘em
I’m like “Hold up, wait a minute
Let’s get down to business
You could kill up all these motherfuckers
Soon as the deal finish”
All out war ‘til we lace something and base something
Don’t say nothing
Scarlet fuck around and grenade something
Exchange something, bodies for dollars
We go two hours to kill
I want a half a mil and a private jet to Brazil
Y’all could forget it ‘cause all negotiations is deaded
The grudge in my heart is embedded
And these are the days that you dreaded

[Verse 2: Blue Velvet]
Scanless fiends, we rise from the midst like submarines
Tote sub-machines
Favorite colors green
Illuminate the scene
Playing devils advocate
State lavish and extravagant
Cats holdin’ chips
We have to get
Ain’t your average chick
Black Madonna, Ms. Maverick
Platinum exposure vi cola
Sword soldier, yo floss rocks like boulders
The ones that make your wrist bend
Televised like Wimbledon
Thug women in Timberlands
Leave you trembling
Sex symboling, swindling
Femme Fatale and Lyte turn thugs to gentlemen

[Chorus]
Ten past nine, Lyte’s time to shine
What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is mine
Synchronize the time, watch the scheming kind
Type to slip you micky, rob you cats blind
Ten past nine, Fatale time to shine
What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is mine
Synchro’ the time, watch the scheming kind
Type to slip you micky, rob you cats blind

[Verse 3:]
Thug princess, relentless
Step to my business
If it ain’t lucrative with interest
It’s senseless
Tigress la temptress
Loving leave ‘em defenseless
Male mind the simplest
Ice Berg can’t pimp this
Lay with a serpent, sin in your semen
Wake up birthing demons
Got Adam? We even
Trick dada trap
Taped to the garter
Master the art of getting ricotta
Documented like Magna Carta
Ill reputed leaving pockets diluted
Intriguing breast protruded, plan precisely executed
Sonned you, slip the micky, never come to
Made off with a bundle
If you wake, death becomes you
It’s all about extortion
Small cats trying to get a portion
What you sporting
Posing, trying to look important
Caution, yo, that lavish life be costing
Before the fame and fortune
Better know what line you’re crossing

[Verse 4: MC Lyte]
I come passive like a cherry, little girl or a peach
Dress dime and I’m fine when I’m trying to get the heap
I show a lot of teeth, front with the sweets
But you know that beneath
There’s a whole lot of street
Don’t test the temper of the do-more-than-talk shitter
Your mens are trapped like the dead of winter
Slide in like a splinter
Pull out with the money and the Lex
We don’t even have to wet him
Leave him drowning in his sweat
Femme Fatale, what’s next?
They about to get me vex
Trying to do me in the pookie
Thinking he gon’ get the sex
Surprise! You’ll be lucky if you ever open your eyes
Or even see the light again, ‘cause I’m about to go in
Don’t question the veteran
You thugs know I’m better than
Anyone or anything or any crew that’s ever been
While you’re listening to this
Got you caught up in the twist
MC Lyte, Femme Fatale
Don’t sweat the fish

[Chorus] (2x)",MC Lyte,My Time,Scarlet
"[ performed by MC Lyte and Milk Dee ( ) ]

A friend of mine (Which one?) Cecilia
(Yeah?) has a man (so?) a dealer
(Which one?) Born - Born Supreme
You know the type (Yeah, I know what you mean)
Gold and cars (cars and gold
The more he got, yo, the more he sold
He told her he loved her (Huh, gased her head)
Her love he bought just to warm his bed
I tried to tell her, but it went out the other ear
She didn't wanna hear, what I had to say
She just replied this way
(Girl, I love him, he treats me so good
He gets much respect in my neighborhood)
I cram to understand why she wants this man
(Yo, he sold the crack to Sam...)

[ Chorus ]
	(I used to be in love...)	
	But not with a dealer
	(I used to be in love...)
	I know how it feels
	(I used to be in love...)
	You make love while he makes deals

The story gets worse, they threaten her life
A guy walked on her (Yo, come here) with a knife
And said (Being with Born is a big mistake
It's a shame your life I have to take
If you leave him now, you'll be alright
If not, you won't make it through the night)
She came to me and said (Lyte, what do I do?)
Forget about Born, or else you're through (Ahh...)
She said (But, but I love him!) Hm, I wonder
Is love worth bein six feet under?
Nope (And that's on the real tip)
I think it's time you skip
Town (Hey girl, don't hang around
Or else you'll be goin -)

[ Chorus ]

Miss C said (No, I'm stayin with my man
He stands by me, so I too must stand)
Girl, you're stupid, you're gonna take a fall
( *phone rings* ) and then she received a call
(Hello? Listen, baby, they got a contract on me
I know because Brian warned me
I'm outta here, goin back to Cali
Grab your stuff and meet me in the alley)
She grabbed her stuff, the gold and the cash
Headed for the door in a flash
She said (I'm outta here) Now wait just a minute
You know he's a dealer, his windows are tinted
(Naw) He has truck jewelry, and no job
(So?) Carries ducats in ??? (So what?)
Now hell the hell does he get these things?
(I don't know!) The Gucci, the Louis, the Polo rings
(Yeah?) Dealers are bad news, take it from Lyte
They say they kill you, and they might
(You're right, Lyte, you tell no lie
Just let me go say good-bye)
She ran down the stairs in a minute or more
I heard a thunderous roar
( *shots* ) Born and Cecilia - killed by Uzis
See why it pays to be choosy?

[ Chorus ]",MC Lyte,Not Wit’ a Dealer,Milk Dee
"Yeah, yeah, ooh
Smooth better that I ever seen him look
As I flip the vibe book
He's on the front page, never looking his age
He's all that and I'm all in so let the games begin

Now I'ma give you something' so you could get into it
I got the side view so I could watch ya do it
You've been on my mind but you're so hard to find
Holly woods got a hold on that behind

I ain't ashamed to play the game
Listen here, I won't say no names
Put your ass out, make your woman put your ass out
If you knew I was talking to you, you would pass out

'Cause I gave you no type of indication
And if I did I was probably on some medication
I got the hots for your daddy and I just begun

Half way across the world I seen you at my show
With your girl back in Italy, but are you still into me?
'Cause if you are I'm here to let you know
You don't have to be a superstar for me and you to go find

Now I ain't never lied you got the body of an angel
Bangle, bangle, watch the bojangle from every angle
I'm clocking you, honey
We could sign a prenup, I got my own money

I just wanna get to know you a little better
In the Lyte after dark on the DL whatever
I wanna feel your muscle flex off your backbone
I got the Jones and I can't leave you alone

I wanna rub your deltoid down to your bicep
Better late than never and I'm sorry I slept
But now I'm well awake and I'm ready for the fun

Damn, the only brother make me look twice
Believe that baby, I wanna sacrifice
I'm on it, you couldn't shake me off if you tried
No sleeping on the job and I'm wide eyed

I like the video you got out, the song is butter
Try to keep a clean head and my mind out the gutter
But it's hard, you bring out the best and the worst
If I knew you way back when I would have let you hit it first

Love, it's like water on the brain
Only you can tame this run away train
Last time I seen ya, gleam in your eye
You was looking fly with your girl by your side

Shit, I ain't trying to take her place
I just wanna have your face all up in my space

"When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes to my head as just chit chatter
You may think it's egotistical or just worry free
But what you say I take none of it seriously
And even if I did I wouldn't tell you so
I'd let you pretend to read me

And then you'll know
Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze
In fact, I despise those who even try
To look into my eyes to see what I am thinking
That dream is over you gotta sink it
I tell all of you like I told all of them
What you say to me is just paper thin, word

I'm not the kind of girl to try to play a man out
I take the money and the gear and then break the hell out
No that's not my strategy, not the game I play
I admit I play game but it's not done that way
Truly when I get involved I give it my heart
I mean my mind, my soul, my body I mean every part
But if it doesn't work out, yo it just doesn't
It wasn't meant to be you know, it just wasn't
So I treat all of you like I treat all of them
What you say to me is still paper thin

In one ear and right out the other
I heard his mumbo jumbo (eeeish) lover
I don't pay attention
I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this
A-hah, a-hah, a-hah
Sucker you missed, I put all feelings aside I know who I am
My name is Lyte is your name Sam?
Cause if it is step off, grab your coat and get lost
Wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope
And hit the road Sam, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Sam, don't you come back no more

So now I take precaution when choosing my mate
I do not touch until the third or fourth date
Then maybe we'll kiss on the fifth or sixth
Time that we meet (mmmuaah) like this
Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
And then maybe I'll let you play with my feet
You could suck the big toe and play with the middle
It's so simple unlike a riddle
It's as easy as counting to 1-2-3
In other terms, letters L-Y-T-E
I'll tell you, you, you and all of you
In the back and in the middle and the front
Yo, that's it paper thin word up

Chorus (Inaya Day)
There's a party goin' on in my hotel room
And you're invited, all you got to do is show up x2

(verse 1)
Now we done left the venue 'coz the show was done
Before we hit the hotel, make a quick run
To get the Martel to add to the fun, meet me at suite room 151
BYOB, we about to kick it off
Remember that party last year in the loft?
This'll be better 'coz we bigger now
Got mo' figures now, fit in mo' niggas now
I got about 30 of the finest
Ready to get flirty and down right do-dirty
We got twister the dots mean a lot
When you flip the dial end up with a face in your twot
Stop yappin' at the DJ, that ain't right
'Coz tonight this here DJ, he gon' save my life... (woah, woah)

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Now the people are comin', and the party is jumpin'...
... and T is on the beat box
And after this song he'll rock the locks
Hotel security ain't troublin' us none
They partyin' with us, no badge and no gun
Grown folks in the livin' room showin' out
And they ain't leavin' till we kick 'em all out
Strip poker, truth or dare
I swear it's about to get sticky up in here
Back back and forth and forth
]From New York to L.A and back to New York
Of course while I'm in town it's gotta be nice
On the North-East corner they're flippin' the dice
Now the bubbly's poppin' all over the suite
Swig on this and kick up your feet
Ain't no party like an MC Lyte party 'coz an MC Lyte party don't stop, pops
And this here's better than when the ball drops

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now here's the E-low, Jackie and Mark
Done hit the back room to jump start the sparks
It's gettin' all hot, now they pumpin' Beenie Man
Scream for the cream, but holler when you see me man
You know like I know, the party don't end till I say when
Now the grub is runnin' out better get it while you can
Pick is gettin' low better find you a man
Slow jam hit and you sittin' all alone
Ain't nobody gonna take you're borin' ass home
It wouldn't be fair for me to not tell you
I'm the hostess of the year, keep it in the clear
Yo, the party's over here, nope, the party's right here
Be careful not to wear and tear the derrier
Now ain't that supmthin', humpin' and a bumpin'
My motto is never let 'em see you comin'
A party like this can't be compared
That's why it only goes down once a year...
... and we in here, yeah yeah yeah..

Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte

[Verse 1:]
Ain't a damn thing changed
You know my name
East coast represent
Watch me do my thing
I'm the female chronic slash gin and tonic
Fuck Johnny Blaze, I'm Johnny Mnemonic
I'm a floss with it
Take it way past the limit
Go back 6 years and throw some G funk in it
MC Lyte long as the money green collect
This is for my dogs hittin' switches in the projects
East side and the west side
Indeed I spit it with finesse right
L's for love me, Y for ""why front?""
T's for truth, E's the exotic flavor you bounce to

[Chorus:]
Lyte is... Brooklyn flavor that'll always be fresh
Lyte is... paid in full I keep my benjamins
Flippin' outfits twice a day
Plus a milked out coupe to push around the way
Grants stacking up every day all day
That's just the way playgirls play

[Verse 2:]
I'm the ultimate intergalactic spectacular
Funk mistress as creamy as Swiss Miss
Hot chocolate I'm the topic, go cop it
Broken microphones cause I rocked it
Who that Lyte? True that, right?
I'm the perfect role model for keepin' your game tight
After this I'm spending four Gs tonight
Cuz money made in the dark comes to the Lyte
Recognize through them blood shot eyes
Think my lyrical skills ain't ill you be surprised
Hypnotized by my Brooklyn vibe
Or we can take it out to Queens where Cool J resides

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 3:]
You're transparent incoherent
Oh you don't know that word
Let me make it more apparent
I sit on chrome stake up chips run up charts
Break up schemes cause wet dreams
Engine engine number 9 on the NY transit line
If you want that flavor back
Lyte it up, Lyte it up, Lyte it up
Who am I? L Y T E
How fly? Oh I'm real jiggy
It's no puzzle how I through the muzzle on the mic
Cuff your CD make it spin all night
I got what you like you like what I got
Hotter than gun shots hotter than most blocks
Hot hot hot to the touch pop the clutch
I won't stop
Larger than life, the most jiggiest
Rippin all the mics apart
I'm gettin' busy
It's all about the cheddar
Nobody do the body better
Never sour but flow like an Amaretta
It's the Lyte y'all, I'm about to take flight
Brooklyn zone got it locked up tight
Show biz your biz doe biz my biz
There it is

I met a guy named Tommy, damn, he charmed me
Met him at the mall, but I knew he wouldn't harm me
We exchanged numbers, hopin to meet again
We couldn't wait for the romance to begin
The relationship grew strong
I didn't wanna be right if this love was wrong
But oh no, came the problems, the first segment
The dumb kid went and got some girl pregnant
The second segment: started wheelin and dealin
Didn't give a damn about how Lyte was feelin
But then he got wise, started treatin me better
Cause all of his friends said I was a go-getter
He knew he was usin me, and abusin me
He also knew that soon he'd be losin me
First I clocked him, yeah, I docked him
But I rocked him - and then I dropped him

Then there was Dave, couldn't behave
So I punished him and put him in my ""Lyte as a Rock"" cave
Then he got bold, tried to play insane
So Bigfoot threw him off my ""Paper Thin"" train
He tried to ""10% Dis"" me, but he pissed me off
Cause I'm the boss, and you know I'm not havin it
Lyte is too dope, and you know I ain't crabbin it
Then there was Henry, way too friendly
I needed a trip, he said he would send me
Pay my airfare, if he could come with me
I said, ""Listen, honey, I don't need your money
Believe me when I tell you, I've got my own
Cause I'm MC Lyte on the microphone""

Here's another story: a dude named Corey
When I used to work, yes, I was a clerk
At the World Trade Center, back in high school
This little player musta thought I was a fool
He took me out to lunch, offered me a ride home
When we got there, he asked could he use my telephone
I said, ""Yeah, sure"", flipped him to the floor
Cause he said ""What's up?"" and tried to feel my butt
I kicked him down the stairs and said, ""What you're provin?""
Rolled him to his car and said, ""Get movin!""
He tried to score it, I wasn't goin for it
You can't play me, I'm Lyte Thee MC
Never saw his face again until last week
All beat up and bleedin down the street
I looked to my left, there was a girl with a pipe in her hand
Sayin, ""Why oh why can't you understand?""

"[Verse 1]
I met him in a club hangin' out one night
He said, ""Hello, I'm George...hi, Lyte
How's everything going, huh? How ya doin'?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and uh umm
Can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
'Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
'Cause George looked good, MMM, damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
'Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
'Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin'
'Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty...""

[Verse 2]
I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation over the phone
He began to comfort me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
That he was the only man I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
That you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care if her ass don't lie
See 'cause Georgie was into making young girls cry

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""
""Kissed the girls and...""

[Verse 3]
George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin' in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin' vodka
I was looking for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin' up, he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some long-haired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests and the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was twelve, he started smokin'
Paid no attention when he started chokin'
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
'Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin'
Wish he was here so I could say somethin'
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promised tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You'll never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow...
Believe that! And don't think that it can't happen to you

We comin' down in '98
Set it straight
For all those that chose to contemplate
We gon' to it 'til the break

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
Rap is hip hop over populated
I made it but I’m still underrated
I go beep beep like a Motorola beeper
Your lines are hard but mines are much deeper
Creeper on the midnight stroll
Never need parole
Totally in control of my destiny
Here’s the best of me
On vinyl finally for all to see
I’m the only one here at the showdown
That don’t need a piece for the shit to go down
""What up Lyte?"" Nigga hell if I know
Trying to keep it real with all my little bros
Wanting to be a friend, some don’t believe
‘Cause in the past they been deceived
But I’m the motherfucker that breeds honesty
Tell you like it is and then leave you where you be

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
So from the east to the west the music is propa
So do it for me, mama
Original rapper
Other MCs slide down the gutter
Soft like butter
Name of the rapper
MC Lyte and Beenie Man deya
So do it to me, mama
Original rapper
Other MCs slide down the gutter
Soft like butter
So listen what my sister say

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
Now you know I gotta keep 2 just like Noah
From Brooklyn to the corner of Balboa
Get a fresh stock keep ‘em on lock
They wanna act like they don’t know the resume
Knowing that I leave shit up in disarray
Never will I ever have to say “Mother may I”
Be this fly until the day I die
Now I realize I don’t need alibis cuz I don’t lie
I’m way too wise
My head he will anoint
I’m the focal point
Have them all screaming, “Yo, that’s the joint!”
As if I didn’t know just how to rock a show
I’m the last dragon to attain the glow
My plans to be to make history
Can’t none of y’all rid hip hop of me

[Verse 3: MC Lyte]
I got game for days in this entertainment shit
I rap shit, act shit, never that wack shit
I'm busting numbers, fuck the crap shit
Coast to coast, niggas know I float
Red eye flights, hitting licks I wrote
‘Cause my dynasty is ordained, I planned it
My reign? Niggas can’t stand it!
They in denial while I’m on the prowl
More than six fouls blowing like Miles
I lay like tiles, crocodile smile
For the naysayers who wanna know how
My plans to be to make history
Can’t none of y’all rid hip hop of me

"[Verse 1:]
I got the nookie that's hooky like a chorus
You wanna winie my poo and get lost in my forest
Some wanna crawl up my sugar walls
Down my waterfall, what a candy call
I put it on you like an ass whipping, it's kinda sick
You wanna lick like Todd do his lips
Well, well, well what the shit
Gotta make it last if you wanna hit this
I'm into multiples, ones don't make it
Tried before but I just can't fake it
Hey it's a greedy world, I'm a greedy girl
Between the sheets it's my world
I gotcha what you like, believe it or not
Bottom of top I put you on the spot
It only takes a sec for me to get into it
Come on baby, let's do this

[Chorus:]
I wanna put it on you and make it hot
Can I put it on you and hit the spot
Can we get together and make it hot
Let's do this

[Verse 2:]
They ask how'd you get so freaky Lyte
How I keep it tight suction all night
Experience and imagination
Now kick your Timbs off get your buckle undone
That's sweet, now turn around baby let me see it
All that I want you can be it, sexual tension just free it
Have you done it on the moon yet, ahh shucks
Where we about to go will make your toes curl up
I'mma shake this money maker
Get your knot ready for the earthquaker
I'mma do you like they do in the Olympics
Flip after flip do you like your best trick
It only takes a sec for me to get into it
All it takes is you for me to wanna do it

"You've heard the hard side, the rough tough side

And yo, I suggest you don't resist
This voyage, you don't wanna miss this

Why would you want it? [2X]

Go ahead spin the rude moves around
If it's faint you feel, then you oughta sit down
And let the beat just seep through the cracks
And crannies of your brain - you can't remember your name
The beat'll tip-tap and takin over your mind
A cure for this hangover, I doubt you can find
So seek if you wanna, cuz imagine your position
If they say there's a potion well then they're probably competition
Lyte has no fear because it overcomes evil
My plan stands strong, not a one is feeble
With no hesitation here's the incantation

(""If there's a cure for this"")
Why would you want it? [2X]

Open up your ears and rev up your gears
This is MC Lyte's train, not ol' steps and stairs
And like I said, I knew you couldn't hack it
So I'll pull out the stretcher and the white straightjacket
You can talk to the fly, for more than a night
But when they ask who put you here, you tell 'em
MC Lyte - crumbs!

Crashin' up in ya joint and knockin' the lights out
Feelin' lovely, trust me, I'm drug free
Only chewed on bringing out the thug in me
Cos you sittin' on my nerves, when we've already heard
That garbage, played-out crap you call rap
Some chicks say they love that, well I'm above that
Calling me a ho won't do it's two, double O two
And my crew roll thick like BIG
Act up, and be puttin' that ass to sleep
You got nothing for me, been there, smelt the dope and
Rollin' with the shelter, making niggas jail free
Like a Luger, I spit thick shit
That a leave ya squad sick, cos I ran up in this shit

Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me

Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

Still got the little frame with the big name
Watch it change cos, nah nigga, we ain't in the same gang
We walk different and we talk a different slang
You a sidekick, and I'm a four point six range
You a one roof flat, I'm fifty acres of land
In Jamaica with your man laid up, gettin' a tan
Thought you knew, I'm overdue
And you're overrated so cats are over you
I inspired you, come on now, no way
? that rumour, the consumer won't believe it anyway
Never play with the messenger, Head on Joan of Arc
When I'm coming through these parts like just cut the dark
I'm a trendsetter, go getter, bringer back
Cos I'm fed up, ready to get a set up
Oh you scurred, vision blurred
Cos I serve these words
And pitch them bitches with a curse

Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

Yo what I'm sayin I've been layin' waitin' for the right situation
New York hawk city playin', back in the BK bomber
Niggas in the hood call me Lyte
But brothers call me Lana Moorer the high scorer
Play fool if you wanna, we closin' after quarter
I started it and I shut the shit down
Sit down, don't nobody move, I'm making haters quit now
Been a long time coming but I'm running with the torch
Race, got a lot a rats but I can't be caught, or bought
Cos I won't sell out, that's why me and the big dogs, we fell out
Not with a major, but I'm still major league
Crash ya dome with this ? then watch your nose bleed
You want it, you can get it anytime
Cos I got many lines for niggas of any kind, you know me

"Gotta who? Gotta have a what?

Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck

[Verse 1]
I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with a attitude
Only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin', timbos draggin'
Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck, so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys, up to no good
C-low on the down low
Cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief
Actin' like he don't care
But all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude, the ruffneck bastard

[Hook]
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck!

[Verse 2]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts, everything is fitting large
But he don’t gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's gotta smack it, lick it, swallow it up style
Drink a beer, sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants, fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy, a raggamuf'
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff, well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that don't snitch like a bitch
Shed tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
He eat, sleep, shit, fuck, eat, sleep, shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
That's the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners, doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect, now that's a ruffneck!

"Within the depths, of this infinite community
Emerges Lyte

[MC Lyte]
One by one they fall in the darkness
I'm glad, that I could take part in this
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte
Finding the Lyte means happiness
It's the best and nothing less
So I'm waiting, at the end of a tunnel
Where happiness comes in bundles
But it takes time, to get to the Lyte
To get in the Lyte, to be with the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

How you get there is this question
Honesty is my suggestion
But first you must be awakened
If you say you are, you're faking
One who has seen the Lyte doesn't have to proof
That they've been moved
They just let it be, let it rest
For that is the mental test
Within this, there's so much happiness
Sort of like lasting moments of bliss
Everyone wants to be so happy
Let me explain my theory:
Some type of grief you MUST experience
In order to appreciate happiness
Cause if you are always satisfied
Life will just pass by, you would've never tried
To get to the Lyte, to get in the Lyte
To be with the Lyte, to go see the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

If you are not ready the Lyte can be BLIND-ING
And not worth finding
So for this you must prepare:
Stay awake, wake up, stay aware!
There are SO, many distractions
Those that see the Lyte, just a fraction
Those that don't, remain blinded
The Lyte is there, they can't find it
One by one they fall in the darkness
And it's sad, to take part in this
But I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Now finding the Lyte is what's so difficult
And you can bet, that the results are
Splenderous, wonderful, yeah
What wouldn't you do?
Cause once you've seen the Lyte, been with the Lyte
Got to the Lyte, got in the Lyte
I know that you just might
Never ever wanna leave the Lyte",MC Lyte,Search 4 the Lyte,

Before this jam starts I'm simply stating
You have all waited, now you can stop waiting
Shall I ease into the disses, go 20, then 30
Or shall I got straight to 80 percent?
Aw, it doesn't matter, when you're dissed, you're dissed
The party's not over, it's just beginning
Because Lyte is winning (What are you winning?)
Any battle in any competition
'The Gangstress'? Ha, you're on a wack journey
(Ho) Headed for nowhere, with time to spare
So I'ma kick this rhyme right now and right here
I'd tell your name, but that would give you fame
And I ain't out to give you what you don't have
So I sit back and relax, cause it makes me laugh
I could diss, call you names and make fun of you
(Ho) But me the Lyte, I'm into speakin the truth
Like a watchtower, hour by the hour
Lyte is rhymin, perfect timin
Milk keeps the beat (I keep the beat)
With the tap of his feet (With the tap of my feet)
When he count it down (When I count it down
6-7-8) Lyte'll start the debate

The first thing you ask yourself is why do I bother?
When you should really ask: where is the father?
(Where is the father?) of your child, aren't we wild?
You get around like a cab, now that's too bad
Everyone has been in you, isn't that sad?
Bodily you're vivacious? Don't make me laugh
Weight Watchers is waiting, here's a free pass
You ain't gettin loose, you fuckin jerk
And you ain't gettin paid, you're just gettin laid
Sexin and suckin, yeah, that is your trade
Put on this earth just to distract me
Get those to write rhymes and try to attack me
You will get nowhere, the Lyte is too blinding
Tell me, why must I keep reminding
You to step back, let the Lyte shine
Do not say shit till you write your own rhymes

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Your mold is fake, crayola, crayon
Don't dare to sleep or even prey on
The Lyte is too wicked, too worthy, too strong
And the rhymes I create are made to last long
Let me wise you up, rappin isn't a sport
You either have to teach yourself, or you have to be taught
And being that you are not wise enough to do it on your own
The ones that write your rhymes might as well hold your microphone
Dropped a little vinyl, now you think you're large
Step aside, Lyte Thee MC is in charge
Don't sleep on me, I'm far, far, far from dumb
So roll correctly if you decide to come
MC sucker, this is what you waited for
I'm sick of the battle, let's go to war
Why do you challenge me, Lyte Thee MC
Did not you know that I am crazy?
My screws are quite loose, in fact I don't have any
But when it comes to rhymes, I've got many
Like I said and will have to say
Over and over, cause you disobey
Here on this earth I reign superior
One of these days I will have to get with ya
Tear you up mentally, from limb to limb
Cause I am the Lyte, and you are just paperthin

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
I sensed it, predicted it, knew it would happen
You plopped off fast on the scene and start rappin
Now it is my duty, to all MC's
To ask you to go elsewhere, pronto, please
Now I was quite polite, nice I might add
But you insist on stayin, that makes me mad
But then again I don't mind, I've got someone to pick on
Write rhymes to diss and even play tricks on
You ain't really down, you wig-wearin clown
Borrowin money to buy an outfit
Not even good enough for a Sunday picnic
I ask you: do you know who you're fuckin with?
With those Bubblegum jeans and those 2-for-1 Skips
I'm MC Lyte a.k.a. MC Payback
Payback is a bitch, and I'm givin you no slack
Unfinished Business, that shit was wack
So Lyte made no attempt to strike back
But here we go again, what is Light's Out?
Let me ask what the bomboclut you a-chat about?
Let me say next time that you feel pissed
I suggest that you don't try to diss

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 5 ]
You better watch what you say to me, cause I can get evil
The things that I'm capable of are unbelievable
In 10% I popped your head in a microwave
I'm into blenders now, so you better behave
Or put you in a toaster, because you're gettin toasted
Better yet an oven, because you're gettin roasted
Don't listen to your rhyme writers, cause yo, they souped you
You ain't dope, you can't cope, they musta dooked you
You musta had some wack crack (real wack crack)
Sent you on a mission, and now you're comin back
But let me school ya, Lyte is runnin this show
So yo, ho, I think you oughta go
Before Lyte Thee MC gets into it (into it)
But remember, you forced me to do it

And knowing is half the battle

"Why is it that your watch stopped tickin, but you still keep clockin?

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm not a procrastinator, or a instigator
But when it comes to dope rhymes on the mic, I'm the creator
I never look for trouble, but somehow it finds me
But yo, I just conquer it, and leave it all behind me
The L-y-t-e, very outspoken
And when I rock a rhyme, sometimes I leave you chokin
I'm the MC Lyte, comin live and direct
I never lose a battle, cause I always come correct
In any case I win, again and again
You see Lyte is at the top till the very end
And even though I may be short, believe, I don't take none
Try your luck and we'll see who will get done
I mean immediately, like quick fast
Don't turn your back, cause this mic'll be in your ass
And don't take what I say too lightly
I beat you, defeat you so quietly
Sneak up and hit you like a fuckin tornado
Cause in the rap field Lyte's the fuckin a/k/a doe
The capital L, the y to the e
Shit, give me room and I'll slay an MC
Whether it's in a crowd, or on the sneak tip
I wax you and your posse watch you trip and flip
As you drop the mic, cause you don't have the gift
To rip a style, fast or slow
(Why, Lyte?) Too busy hoein it, sniffin up blow
Don't get mad, it's just a talent I was given
What I'm sayin, I'm a slave to the rhythm

[ VERSE 2 ]
Bein that I'm dissin, I was reminiscin
You was at my show, yo, you was on a mission
(Yo, what you tellin me, Lyte?) she was ass-kissin
No show, you hoe, no work, you jerk
(Cool, Lyte, I think her feelings are hurt)
Alright, I'll chill and I'll come to my senses
But next time you diss, think of the consequences
Yo, I am no joke, I'm sharp like barbwire
Try to touch me, yo, you're bound to catch a fire
I never lose my cool, but if I do, yo, you're lost
I be forced to show and prove exactly who's the boss
Who gets the income - and then some
I don't diss you for the money, I diss you for the fun
Don't get mad, it's just a talent I was given
What I'm sayin, I'm a slave to the rhythm

[ VERSE 3 ]
It took a whole album for you to try and diss me
And ha-ha-ha, slum bitch, you still missed me
But yo, I'm off the dissin tip, cause that takes no creation
I'm into other things that bring me commendation
So I rap about funny things, or issues that are serious
Sometimes I rap a topic that leave my people curious
And other times I diss to put one in their place
If I diss you on wax, then I will diss you to your face
Some say I'm foul, and they don't like the way I'm livin
But yo, ask me if I care...
I'm just a slave, I'm just a slave, I'm just a slave

Now I know I didn't come just to take up space
The night is right, and the stars are bright
So c'mon now brother just treat me right
And just take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can SWING
I don't smoke and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love well that would be a lie
Because I do every chance I get
But if I don't I won't fall I won't fret
I'm no fool I got plenty of sense
So I just be cool, and have patience
Make up your mind, please let me know
And when you give me the green that's when I'll go
So please pretty boy don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
You tried the rest and I tried the best
And when the time comes boy no regrets
And just take it off

Now take off your hat, untie your shoelace
And after you finish, I want you to face me
Now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other girls so don't compare me
Tender lovin care is all I give
And if possible boy, well I would like to live with you
And if I do it ain't everybody's business
It seems to me ya just how you got into this
Take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I seen this dude who was built very well
Face was handsome, body was fine
How did I know, I was cruisin behind him
Looked at the car, looked at me
Then he asked me my name, I told him Lyte the MC but
I didn't want to outplay my hand
So I talked so smooth he could understand me
He was definitely the move
I only said sweet things, that could soothe him
Opened up the door, and he got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told him take it off - I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can swing
I mean take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby until the last drop

Met this guy at an amusement park
He was good to go and it was after dark
You can guess girls what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time baby
Instead the boy asked me my sign
And I said, ""Why?"" and he said, ""Never mind.""
When the time come and it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign don't make a difference only how you make love to me
You make me feel so good you're a man
Oooh baby I melt like cotton candy
If I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and I'd also be your wife
So let's take a bout through the tunnel of life
Because you know what I'm thinkin of..
.. c'mon baby just take it off

Take it off
Take it off
That's right, now take it off
Take it off
Pal Joey, take it off
C'mon now, take it off",MC Lyte,Take it Off,

So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

[Mc Lyte]
It's like the wonder years you blink and I appear
From a cloud of smoke I'm like a full court press and you choke
When I'm near pull up a chair let me explain how I maintain the youthful glow
For you that don't know it's called H2O
So stop asking when I walk by
How I look so young and stay that fly
It's elementary, kick the liquor when you turn dirty thirty
The rest is a secret so I keep it for the worthy
Some of us need to be doing the bid
Spitting lyrics that's worst than Ritalin for kids
They say ""Lyte they ain't ready for nothin' you did""
So we kick the same stuff as if we were stupid
Take the same beat and loop
50 times, Why not? that other group did
It's idiotic, average and robotic
I keep it real my mental thick like a Harvard clique
I got them singing Bob Marley hits. (I don't want to wait.)
They don't want to wait in vain
But I'm worth all the joy and the pain
Come hard when I hit, goddamn you know the name Lyte

[Hook]
Lock this down like its supposed to be
The pioneers wonder years L-Y-T-E
Oh yeah she's back the industry need that
So pay attention to her I told y'all to listen to her
Yeah Lyte she's back, the female G-Rap been in the limelight
Baby girl get your mind right

(Yeah I'mma do it like this)

[Mc Lyte]
Pass on the insight, teach a seed about Lyte
And how I was the first female to smash the mic
Yeah nigga, I speak the facts of life
While a whole lot of others was crap on the mic
Still showin Mc's what cash look like
From the Jetta to the porsche to the navi I'm tight
What I got it's hot you can have it to
Praise god, work hard all you have to do
I was born to be the Lyte to give the spark in the dark
Spread the truth to the youth, the ghetto joan of ark
It's sad these kids put you at the head of thier throne
All you give them back is raps about your bone
Gettin head in your whip, a studio in your home
But who cares cause you dummies all sound like clones
It's a mystery to me how you got this far
Can't read, can't even count the miles on your car

[Hook]

[Mc Lyte]
Yeah, You take this easy, slow it up on them
I feel the animosity
Loosen up the grip when I shoot from the lip, I hear it constantly
""Yo Lyte kick that same shit you did in '86""
I can't do that, I'm too evolved too big to stay small
In a world full of problems, especially the U.S just can't solve them
My data too robust they can't feel where I'm headed
How I keep the mind, spirit and the body all connected
Respected by many and any that want to test
Bring them Timbos and leave home that pretty mini dress
I'm a viking I'm fighting until the death of me
As god blows breathe in me, I leave the legacy
Lyte as a Rock!

[Hook]",MC Lyte,The Wonder Years,
"Yo Milk, that's super duper
I think I need a soundcheck

Yeah, now what about that dope stuff?
Alright, now give me a 808
Now let the beat roll..

[ VERSE 1 ]
Any competition, checkers or chess
Whatever the game, Lyte'll never fess
But did you say rappin? Cause I'm with it
I hold the title, you might as well forget it
You can put me to the test, I'll prove I am the best
You'll be the last cuckoo to fly over the nest
Try to dis this? Nah..
You'll be the only scarface in the place
Cause I'll rip out your eyes, cut your tongue off
You can't talk no more and let the bullshit walk
In this lifetime you're no MC
You're just labelled in bold black ink as a wanna-be
Now that I pulled your card and I read you
I should punish those that misled you
Into thinkin that you was just too good
I beat your ass in your own neighborhood
I have yet to threaten you with sticks and stones
That'll hurt your bones

[ VERSE 2 ]
I step in a jam, they know who I am
All I do is smile and the crowds go wild
MC Lyte's on top of the pile
Waitin to put a sucker in her place
Won't hesitate to dis a bitch to her face
Cause you're a half-assed MC, a part-time hooker
When talent was given out, they overlooked ya
I rock ya blindfolded, better yet with no mic
Hype it acappella, make your deejay go on strike
This kinda comp I know you're not ready for
You're just a amateur dying to explore
Territory that is soon to be conquered by Lyte
Tonight, alright, alright, alright, alright..

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I think you better leave now, your mommy is callin you
Rap is like a pit and your whole crew is fallin through
But once I'm gone there ain't no catchin me
I'm talkin bon voyage, I mean you're history
I'm takin my fans to a new land
If anyone can do it, Lyte Thee MC can
Because I'm hypin my rhyme to a new hype
So get equipped and prepare yourself for the flight
Cause yo, you're about to enter a new dimension
Sit back and listen, Lyte is on a mission
I'm takin out those who attempt to oppose me
And even those that try to get close to me

Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly

Juicy like a nectarine when I hit the scene
My game is long and lean like a limousine
I told you from the ""get,"" I was the wet dream
How simple did it seem to smudge my Maybelline
Now you wanna play like you're hard to get
Should I play how easy you are to forget?
My girls told me I was out to prove 'em wrong
They said you was a jackass and wouldn't last long
Trust me on this here before I let you hit it
I knew your dumb ass would last about a minute
I'm too fly for what you got to give to me
I got niggas out there dying to live for me
Now you wanna act like you're playing it
Like I'm supposed to run and catch your dumb ass, bitch?
You was foolish now to let this one go by
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
You used to love me, my love thang
I used to love you, with tender loving care
And I'll take you there
And I'll take you there

[Verse 2:]
Had you driving my Yukon on my Motorola
Now you at the pay phone downing a Corona
All dried up, trying to chase the blues away
Not another like me will ever come your way
I even got you new kicks, but there will be
No more of that, you'll be wishing you had this
Besides that, I treated you well
But your ass was just too jacked up to tell
Your boy around the way? Your arch enemy?
Asked me for my digits, wanted to get with me
First I told him no can do, I'm with you
But new show, new day in New York, forget you
Had me wasting my time as well as my money
Tell your little sister ain't a damn thing funny
Next time I see her, I'mma poke her in the eye
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
How you gonna game me? I made the rules
An ass like you only playing to lose
Next time be leery of which one you choose
Picking somebody out, thinking you're about to use
They say you only meet the true love of your life
Once throughout your years, better make her your wife
Now you picked the wrong one to let go by, nigga
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly

"MC am I, people call me Milk
When I'm bustin' up a party I feel no guilt
Milk is cuttin' up for the
Suckers that's down with me

The one of us, that's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the two, we're rated R
We're gifted, and we're going far

Down the road, to the bank
While I'm here I'd like to thank
Mom and dad, they knew the time
T is scratching, Lyte is rhyming

Milk is chillin', Lyte is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
Since you understood, would you?

Stop scheming, and looking hard
I got a great big bodyguard
So step up if you wanna get hurt
Milk Dee's gonna pull the skirt

I gets money, money I got
Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
That's how it is, you can ask Giz
I stole your nigga while you was in prison

Jail, for MC assault
You was jealous it's all your fault

Milk is chillin', Lyte is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you?

Clap your hands, your hands you clap
If your girl's out of place it's your girl I slap

And if you're dumb, you'll ask why?
I am from that do or die

I got a brother and his name's Milk Dee

Milk is chillin', Lyte chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
Since you understood, would you?

Bite a rhyme, if you dare
I get the papers so I don't care
My contributions to this jam
Is confusing, because I am

Milk Dee's dated all the way
The super easy mightiest MC okay
Yes I'm down, down by law
I get the fellas out on the floor

Milk is Dee, down is he
Two the, at the top is where he'll be
The place was packed, when we toured
Girls come in you won't be bored

"TRG we making that cream
People get fooled it ain't easy as it seems
You can rock on till the break of dawn
But one by one your ass is gone
I got trapped in the rap game at sixteen and saw
It's no more than a crap game, know what I mean?
Like when you feel you shake 'em right they fake roll snake
Eyes in the this industry that's how quick niggas die
Through my eyes its like Russian roulette
Never do you know when you about to get wet
So you should stay set so you don't fall and go under
Have people saying I wonder what happened to him or her
It's sad when you being to think you can be gone but you
Can be gone in the blink of an eye, don't ask why cause you try
Somebody came along that was twice as fly
I remember when I hit the seen it was the second faze
Rope chains two finger rings, those where the days
Latin quarters m y puma suit was cool
Now let me be caught in that and I'll be damned a fool ya
Gotta changed with the times like the weather
MC's that lasts is the MC's that's clover
You can't move to slow cause when
It's to time to go, you see it's to time to go
TRG we making that cream
People get fooled it ain't easy as it seems
You can rock on till the break of dawn
But one day brother your ass is gone
TRG we making that cream
People get fooled it ain't easy as it seems
You can rock on till the break of dawn
But one day sister your ass is gone
Come back after come back, nigga came back more wack
Than the wackest wax on the rack, what's up with
That New Jacks are coming through taking no slack
They hungry and they looking for a spot to cop a squat
You better watch the clock it can be awfully embarrassing
To not know when it's time to let go of the rhyme
It's about half past the monkeys ass
You should have been gone but you
Still trying to hang on, what happens when you
Chilling at the level on the 10th floor nobody
Knows your name anymore, aren't you?
Wait and let me think, just as quick as you
Got large you can quickly shrink & sink into the crates and
Collect dust, don't be mad cause it happens to best of us
TRG we making that cream
People get fooled it ain't easy as it seems
You can rock on till the break of dawn
But one by one your ass is gone
TRG we making that cream
People get fooled it ain't easy as it seems
You can rock on till the break of dawn
But one by one your ass is gone
To and from they come and go, you better change your flow
And then switch up your show, I seen some come with the
Booming ass hits, then they gone but then they don't leave
With shit, you better tell an exec you need to be set
So when it's over you ain't living out your Land Rover
When you rap life dies
And you still alive nigga, you better know how to
Survive it ain't easy and it ain't supposed to be
Letting niggas know what time it is
When it comes to me the L-Y-T-E
Stronger than the ox the octane that
Knocks in your brain I sustain
My mission is to maintain sane, know what I mean
Keep doing my thang, you can't move too slow
Cause when it's your time to go you gotta go, gotta go

When in Love (3X)

When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night, everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
It'll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard, I've done some effed up things
From kicking them in the Nerfs, to throwin away his ring
So if you love me, love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
I'm not embarassed, nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past, I've been gamed
But that was then, and this is now
And there's no way damn it, there's no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love

When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say, ""I must have been deranged!""
I'm talkin like pickin your lover's nose
Cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car?
You could be partyin and havin a ball
But you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
Waitin for the phone to ring -- that ain't right!
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin, you'd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love (2X)

When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job, hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
Like two-seater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens, she got you strung
Guess it doesn't matter long as you're having fun
Love'll make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said, ""Love makes things happen""
It's most important, to hear what I'm rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

I'm the chick that never front it
Picture that
Me wearin a pager
So you can be down my back
It ain't happin jack
Am I too fine?
If so I can leave
Have somewhere to go
You better believe
I keep a tight schedule
Not many are blessed
Still on a quest
Not knowin I'm da best
Causin a mess wherever I go
They still want me there I'm the star of the show
Your ride is sweet
My ride is much sweeter
Come take a ride with this senorita
Theres more to me that the eye can't see
But I'm twice as much as you'd thought I'd be
When I hit da scene
All better be where cause da party don't jump till I get there

Now I don't know
If you can hang wit my flow
Keep it on da dlow I start da fire
Watch it go down
When it's time to put the flame out
I put the juice down
When you woo-woo
So nasty it's sick Wanna know my tricks
Studyin' me like a flick
I'm the girl your mama warned you about at night
Ask Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike
I'm that candy girl
I got da suga for your sweet toothe
Comin in your crib in my birthday suit
I'm that, bad habit you just can't shake
What I want I take
Some a y'all could relate
Got the yab yum
To get ya stuck like glue
It ain't over to we all come through
When I hit the scene
All better be where cause da party don't jump til I get there

Chorus x 2

Verse 3: MC Lyte

So you wanna be da tiger roaming through my woods huh
Babe boy you gotta bring da goods
Not just any penny
Can get in my piggy
Bently or empty you just can't tip me
Lyte got, just what you like
All up in your ear but I'm not like Mike
Red Hot
Be the brown chili peppa
Y'all know my words
Let's sing it together
Light to infinite
Like Dusk Til Dawn
When I hit da scene
All better beware cause da party don't ump da jump til I get there

Chorus repeat til fades",MC Lyte,Woo Woo (Freak Out),Nicci Gilbert
"Libra, Cancer Gemini, Pisces, what's your zodiac sign
Aries Aquarius, Taurus, Sagitarius, Leo, Virgo
Capricorn, Scorpio, when were you born, What's your sign

One zero the month of the year
I'm not a hero but I come when in despair
I float like the wind, the mighty air sign
When I use my mind its not hard to find
Those who would not like to see me fly
Rather step on my wings and watch me die
But that can never be I use my skills
Postitive, negative energy male and female
Emotions within me Leo, Aquarius compatibility
Also Gemini but I got four eyes for one set of twins
I look deep within
Often distracted by pretty little things
Like the wings of an angel or the song they may sing
Argumentative but I hate confrontation
Ruled by Venus and starked with hesitation
Procrastincator, never an instigator
You wanna riff homie I'll see you later
Sapphire, My type of jewel
I turn on one who thinls he knows me too well
Like the water barrier with the million dollar smile
Flowing like the Nile or the waters from the Panama canal
Pisces a fabulous catch
They remain detached
Yet to find a match
Don't lose your breath waiting to exhale, I shall prevail
Weighing souls on the scale
Follow me as we take this trip through astrology
The galaxy from Pluto to Mercury
What ya gonna do when the planets line up
Your time is up and your city blows up
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear none
I'm at one with the sun till I'm done
Astrologically speaking on the track
Dropping solar facts about the zodiac
The sun and the mooon and the stars
Make up the universe Earth is not far from the planet Mars
Virgo the virgin running from the twins
Stung by the Scorpio running through the Lions den
Ram with legs of a crab
With the half man half horse waiting in the past
Of course if you check the math its all symbolical
Horoscopes are purely logic

Libra, Cancer Gemini, Pisces, what's your zodiac sign
Aries Aquarius, Taurus, Sagitarius, Leo, Virgo
Capricorn, Scorpio, when were you born, What's your sign",MC Lyte,Zodiac,
