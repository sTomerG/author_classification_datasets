"[Fantasia]
Like your name is MISSY ELLIOTT, my name is Fantasia Barrino
And what I can GIVE YOU is Fantasia Barrino
Holla at your girl

[Missy]
Two thousand five!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Wake up in the mornin with my man next to me
Up all night like we've been on that ecstasy (YES!)
Mixed with Hennessy, he got the remedy
Yeah my nigga into me, I can't say it simply
We, take a quick shower for the hour conversation
Time to have relation, love makin in the basement
Smack it up, flip it up, crush it
One minute, two minute, I was no question (AHH!)
Who would ever think that I'd be givin up the goodies
Walkin 'round naked in a pair of pink footies (HA!)
Just like them hoes at the shows
Half-dressed clothes doin whatever, who knows (OH-KAY!)
Nah I only get freaky with him
No menage-a-trois, not freaky with them (WOO!)
It's just me and my man
Yes, said me and my man

[Hook: Fantasia]
For my man, I'll do whatever
Cause what I feel, this love, it make me do thangs
For my man, I'll last forever
Cause what I feel, this love, it won't never change

[Missy]
I'm never insecure when we not together
Even though he tell me he in love with Ciara
I'm from a new era and I bring terror
To any chick who check my fella when we together, so
He treat me like a Cinderella, yup
Protect me from the storm like he my umbrella (okay)
This fella deserve primo stellar, he be a Roc-A-Fella
Not to Jay-Z and Dame but the charm on the chain be platinum
Jacob Roley lookin sporty, {?}
Money stackin keep track and I fax him
If I can't find his ass then his ass out of gas
He only gettin one pass (OH-KAY!)
My man, is my man and nobody else's
Damn right, I hope y'all felt this
Old ladies 'round the coast-es
You better get focuses 'fore you ever try to approacheth

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Missy]
See when you in love you might have to say it
Don't say you won't, never say you won't
You might get real mad, wan' act all bad
Act up in the street, a few chicks you gotta beat
Cause they disrespect (disrespect)
Clockin your man from his feets to his neck, UHH
You gotta let her know that's a no-no, slap her real slow
With a right blow whichever way it go
And keep it gangster
Show these bitches that you can't come
Yank 'em, point blank 'em, top rank 'em
I ride for my nigga and I'm happy with the trigger (YES!)
Scared how you figure?
My man (OH-KAY!) Say it time again
Say my man (my man) my man again
I say my man, it's just me and my man
Said for me and my man

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Scratched] That's my man.. yes it is.. this love..",Missy Elliott,4 My Man,Fantasia
"[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Uhh, yo

AAAAOOW!!

[Break: Missy Elliott]
People, gangsters and pimps and people
Smokin' that lethal reefer
Up in the club wit speakers
Hi hats, some base and tweeters

Sweat till I catch a fever
Call me the illest diva
(Yo I'm on fire!)
People go head and drink up
Get in the club get fucked up
See me you got get lucked up
Someone to touch and rub up
Show me some love, strip off your clothes, and take off your socks

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
The party's jumpin', I see something fine
Boy I wanna kiss you, but I'm just too shy
Let me dance with you, let me wear you out
Here's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out
The music's bangin', way down in my soul
When you dance behind me, I lose all control
Make me grind my hips, make me move my waist
When the music comes on, you take my breath away

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
This is for my people, my party people
This is for my people, my motherfucking people
C'mon
C'mon, get down, get, get on down
C'mon

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
I'm at the bar now, and I'm buying drinks
And I got this feeling, and it's all over me
I wanna dance with you, and lick your face
Take me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy
The vibe is right now, and I'm bout to score
Mr. DJ can you play this joint once more
Cuz' I see the man I want, I want him right away
I'm look him right in his face and say dance with me

Uno... dos... tres...
Uno... dos... tres...

[Verse 3: Eve]
Can't stand when a nigga fuckin up my plans
All night ducking him, while I'm tryin to dance
Drunk, and his breath stink, freaky with his hands
Cocky with his mouth please like he got a fan
Can't stand when a bitch all in my side
I don't even know her and she all up in my light
Givin' me the side eye like she wanna fight
Philly known for boxing bitch better get it right
Can't stand when a DJ fuckin' up the song
Know I'm tryin to shake my ass all night long
Cuttin' up the same shit all night long
High 'fore I got there, now my shit is blown
Can't stand when it ain't jumpin' like I want
Bouncer tryna stop my fun, take away my blunt
I don't give a fuck he ain't gon' take away my fun
See him when this shit is over, make a nigga run, uh

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
This is for my people, my party people
This is for my people, my motherfucking people
C'mon
C'mon, get down, get, get on down

Now I'm in the 9th inning

Yeah, I'm about to put my foot in it, talk with it, walk with it
I'm no gimmick

Haters y'all lame, you a Missy fan!
I'm a beast in a booth, I'm just sayin'
Yeah, I make 'em wanna get low
Duck with it, buck with it, let's go
Every time I spin around, it's a sick flow
You newcomers better sit back and take notes
Yeah, this here my time
Yeah I've come better run, take what's mine
Bite the dead off like a tick line
This rhyme gonna make 'em push rewind
Yeah I'm so hot, up on the charts, number one spot
You see me when I drop, and I won't flop
Missy never stop, got the music game on lock (yeah)
Wanna get served?
You third, you second, but I come first

To give you to the ""G"", and never claim you

And this how we do it
Yo Missy, tell 'em how you feel, what

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Beat biter, dope style taker, originator
Or just an imitator
Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em
Timbaland's the teacher and I'm the one to grade 'em
Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em
How dare you make 'em, just like we made 'em
And I won't play 'em, and I won't say 'em
Save this for later, so I can tell you straighter

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Get rowdy (Aha!)
Let me hear y'all loudly (What you got fool?)
Keep my high niggas 'round me (Keep 'em 'round me!)
Let me see y'all work it and work it till y'all can't stand up
Get rowdy (Get rowdy!)
Let me hear y'all loudly (Aha!)
Keep my high niggas 'round me (Keep 'em 'round me!)
Let me see y'all work it, baby, work, work it baby, what!

This is for everybody (Ooh)
This is for my people East (What, what?) (Ooh)
East, West, South

But you know what, before I get up on outta here (Ooh)
I gotta say one thing to y'all beat biters (Ooh)
It's 'bout to be the year 2000 (Ooh)
You know what I'm sayin'?
And I'm kinda sick of that (Kack, kack, kack, kack, ficky-boom, ficky-boom)
That (Kack, kack, kack, kack, ficky boom, ficky boom)
That (Kack, kack, kack, kack, ficky boom, ficky boom)

On everything, y'all gotta come up with
Y'all own creativity, y'all own originality, y'all own style
You know what I'm sayin'
Heh, you gonna be left behind this time

Made the bro' shout
Look out, make it live

[Verse 1: Missy]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Ooh baby, what's your name? (HA?)
I love the way you're spittin' the game
You made me change from thinkin' all guys the same
You the type of guy I wanna marry in months
Got exactly what I want (HA?)
And ain't no fakin' the funk
Your attitude is funk and you're makin' me crunk (C'mon)

Yes it's real baby

Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Ohh, you won't be sorry
My papi, I'm yo' mami

[Verse 2: Missy]
I'm in your life to come and let you explore (HA?)
And take you on a tour
The kind of guys that be talkin' that noise
Is the reason I ignore (UH-HA!)
And you the one I wanna take to MEET MOMS
""He's a rap superstar"" (UH-HA!)
I wanna be the one
You like, I'm sure to do you right

Yes it's real baby
Got me so crazy

Crunk just like a party

[Verse 3: Method Man (Missy)]
Is it real hon, if it's really real? (Let's chill)
Maybe pop an X pill (How the sex feel?)
Come and get your next thrill (You the raw deal)
Yo I'm sayin if your man won't (Mr. Meth will)
That's amoré, all day, mind over matter
And my forte is foreplay, sex on a platter have it your way
Then who, serve you everything on the menu
And all that freak shit that you into?
Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy
Maybe, we can go half on a baby (On a baby?)
Poppa got a brand new bag
Hidden in the stash of his brand new Jag
Lovely, kick your shoes off and get comfy
We can bump uglies if you ain't got your monthly
Yes I, like ""American Pie""

Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes
Like a soap opera episode
Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate:
Girls, women, and bitches (What?)
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night
The stalker that walks awkward
Stick figured with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking [pregnant] bitch in her [stomach] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out
I black out or back out
Lookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate it to English
Then I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (One more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me (One, two)
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology (Whoops)
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (Shut up!)
I made this rap game suspenseful
Cause now I got an impulse game to insult you wit a pencil (Bitch)
They waste the paper on you, chopping down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'

[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Eminem, Missy)]
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tec's at you until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you (Ah!)
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth (Grrr)
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half, suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'mma get the East and West beefing again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

Don't shoot Missy! Get back

Never fear, 'cause pissy Missy's through the crowd

Big things pop, little things stop
If you talk a lot, in your mouth you get socked

House on the water, Aston Martin in the lot
Look at my watch, cost a whole lot
So iced out you cain't see it tick-tock
Yeah, I'm so hot and I can't be topped
Artists drop down like Michael Jackson socks
Got the game lock, make ya body rock
If Missy ain't on it, then ya song don't knock
You might get mopped like a floor so don't walk
You don't need to spit unless you live what you talk

"[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Uhh, 3000 baby
Uh huh
Ooh, raunchy, raunchy

[Verse 1: Redman]
Good riddance, to niggas and bitches bullshittin'
I house MC's like baths and full kitchens, ready or not
Doc, hood lynchin', icy flows
I write with wool mittens
It's two, not one
Missy dot dot com
Come once in the blue like free hot lunch
So once it's on, turn it up, chickens flockin' in
Shoppin' at birds are us, murderous
Don't blame me, blame the music
I write with napalms in my hands
Flame the fuses, like ca psss, off you go
I'm nice battin', I practice when the park is closed
I'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans
Jump to roof to roof on the TV cam, I fuck a model
I go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me trippin'
Like Kima, Keisha and Pam
I remain cool like, like open house on a school night
Animal House gettin' thrown out for food fights
PPP strictly don't give a fuck
And Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Let me intervene, come between, like dick through your jeans
Hang down to your knees, it's mwa the Don-Wan
Carry on, D.A.N. to the danger
Y'all MC's in a whole lot of danger
Change up all your rhymes you need beats
My beats you see completely unique, forgive thee
See its the shots of Henessey that's in me
Reggie Noble through after me

[Verse 3: Redman (& Missy Elliott)]
It takes two to tango, and two to fuck
I done fucked in Range Rovers to Isuzu trucks
Used to move weight, now you makin' moves to duck
Built solid without bolts, screws and nuts
Pussy tight, Jiffy Lube it up
Doc came up, hoes use to hang up
Now my arm close hang em
My crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets
We don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for the occasion
One shot will have you ravin', like Symone when the four four is blown
Two minutes later I'll make it hotter
Snap you from the vine to my medulla oblongata
(So what you wanna do, what you wanna do?)

[Bridge: Redman]
Yo, I got the chickens, the brews
Take X and mushrooms
Def Squad in the house bitch, drop your drawers
Tell your boyfriend to ease up, and park his car

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
I'm from the south, you better watch your mouth
It's the M-I, the S-I, if you try, then you die
I don't take no mercy on you suckers so
Would you still be in love, baby, if I cut your throat, cut the jokes?
I ain't got no love for yo
No friends with those, who imitate me ya bold
My style I own, I'mma have to steal your flow, you know me Joe
I gotta say no more, BITCH!

It's very necessary, on the contrary
No you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary?
But shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy, cuz my period is heavy
I used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that Bevy
My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me
And now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri
And Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry
The life he live's a fairy, cartoon like ""Tom and Jerry""
My flow is legendary and your style is temporary
Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary
The words that I spit don't fit in that category
Is my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry
Me without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry
And yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry

Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite

This is an old school Missy exclusive

[Verse 1]
Look!
I ain't on no ra-ra shit
You dont wanna test how far Miss get
Me and Timothy cars got kits
But we don't drive around trying to prove you shit
Everyone tryna be that bitch
But there can only be one bitch make hits
I know I must make y'all sick
Cuz after I spit, you beg to quit
I used to drive a six
And then I bought a Murciélago to sit
On the plush leather seats, forget
Am I on my own clit?
Yes I must admit
And my ass is it
Misdemeanor have you seen her?  I'm the best it get
And those who try to test this chick
Where they at right now?  In peace resting in

[Chorus]
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure

[Verse 2]
Yeah boo you know you a joke
Wear a fake Rolex, call it a Ro
Act like you down with so and so
Ya whack on wax, bows I came to throw
I might just let you mop my flow
For my autograph take this flick to go
(CHEESE)
Miss don't say no mo'
Cuz you know what I do
And you know what I know
And I don't think so
You don't wanna lose a arm or elbow
If ya broke then just say so
Cuz the Bentley that you renting
Yo it's got to go
Back to the black man store
Along with ya weave cop a new afro
Why you wanna make Miss stoop so low
But if you try to test me I just check ya slow

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure

[Verse 3]
In old school we used to call out names
But I ain't tryin' to give ya no fame
My credit card gonna bring ya pain
To know ya account just hold change
No need to wreck ya brains
Trying to see who Missy gon' slain
I roll solo not with a gang
I don't carry guns kick ass wit a chain
Don't let me say it again
I don't carry guns kick ass with a chain
(WHASSSSA)
Like a Chinese man
Reverse it
(ti esrever)
Know what I'm saying

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats

Watch how my glu-te-us dangle
I do a one-two step STOP!
No I ain't done yet
Everybody in the club go to work
Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts
I'm gone rock to the beat till it hurt
I'm gone drop it on the street yeah you heard

Mane on main if you decide to put your hands
On my fucking light, like the cigarettes I light

""Hey lady, look. This a jack move!""
""Fried chicken, pork chops, chitlins, collard greens... What's wrong with you, eh? I have to get back to the kitchen. My cabbage is burning.""
""Yeah, I want the cabbage and your collard greens. All of it. Right now.""
""Besides, you're making me miss my favorite episode Fear Factor! I wonder if the ribs are done. You boys want to know chef's favorite recipe for musicals?""
""I don't wanna know no chef recipe?! Go 'head. Get the pump! Gon' and get the pump.""

Timbo, what they do
They try to be like Missy but they have no clue
On how I'm spittin over beats the way I move
I move so smooth in my shell toe shoes
Now put the needle on the record, show'n'prove
Since ninety-two I came to win and never lose
They try to stop a chubby chick from comin through
My belly out and sellin out these venues
My skills, will fulfill, those who drink booze
My attitude is super cool like I'm subdued
And those who fake I take on you and your dudes
I rule the streets I break 'em down with no tools
And Misdemeanor give the finger to y'all fools (HOLLA!)
Whoever doubted that I'm 'bout it check the news
And if you snooze on me this year your ass will lose
Cause I will bruise, my loose screws is like ooh
When I come out, get your release dates moved

This year y'all gon' all lose sleep

I flow over a beat that make a chick weave blow
And those who try to compete to the wall I throw
So I drop it low, 808 kick low
Like oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Mr. Mos', this beat he compose
While I kill the track, leave your ears decomposed
Fake rappers, this year your lies will be exposed
Like oh oh-oh oh, oh Missy steal the show-ow-ow
Spit on breakbeats, make rappers lose sleep
Make labels unable drop they artists on leak
I keep 'em knee deep, need me, be me
Hardly, and basically, I do it nice and slow-ow-ow

Wherever you talkin noise is where you gon' lay at

Before the fame majors used to diss me
But now I'm on top, I'm hot I can't stop
Before my deal came my shows was sold out
House been on the hill, diamonds been in my grill

"What's up motherfuckers?
I need to know is V-A up in this bitch?
New York, St. Louis, Chicago, Philly, LA, Atlanta
I'm diggin' that
But how about the ladies that got a head full of fake weave or braids
Holla at ya peoples
Oh! C'mon

Ooh baby let me fix my weave
Touch me up and let me fix my weave
You could pick me up about a quarter to 3
Before I walk in the club I gotta fix my weave
(Oh) Baby fix my weave
Baby baby let me fix my weave
On the highway I do above 90
(woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID

I met a guy named Tommy
Very charming
He was on me like cheese be on macaroni
His game real tight making me so horny
Fine enough for us to fuck and be his baby mommy
You really don't know me
So I moves it slowly
Brush up and let him hold me
Let me spit some baloney
Baby you could call me
If you go down on me
But you got to back up off me
Wearing cubic zirconia
I told him, ""Baby let me fix my weave
I got a hair out of place and use a fake ID.""
Pepe LePew voulez vous ooh oui
You want to misdemeanor me
You gotta spend more G's (ohhwee)

Ooh baby let me fix my weave
Touch me up and let me fix my weave
You could pick me up about a quarter to 3
Before I walk in the club I gotta fix my weave
(Oohwee) Baby fix my weave
Baby baby let me fix my weave
On the highway I do above 90
(woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID

I used to date a guy named Chris
Sloppy with his kiss
But he was good with his tongue
I called him Mr. Young One
Mr. Young One had a big ding-dong
Balls the size of ping-pong
I had him souped like won-ton
I put the beat on
And on my ass he skeet on
I put the heat on young gun
Fresh meat he season
Yes, yes we used to creep down the beach
He was insane like Rick James
And with a mask he's Superfreak
I told him, ""Gimme cash to fix my weave
And I don't want no excuses 'bout your baby mommy
Cause your child support money don't fix my weave
And you know nigga please me no fuck for free.""

Ooh baby let me fix my weave
Touch me up and let me fix my weave
You could pick me up about a quarter to 3
Before I walk in the club I gotta fix my weave

On the highway I do above 90

I got a call from Joe
He used to call me J.Lo
Hey-lo, how you doing?
Used to ask who I was screwing
Joe was pursuing
Sex was good all ""ooh-in""
Moan he was grown
He would fuck me 'til the mo'nin'
I used to get vex when he would sex another bitch
Said ""Baby don't trip, just like Ben I'm rich""
Jen don't bitch, then Miss don't bitch
Lopez get rich, call me Miss Affleck
I tell him, ""Baby I need a new weave
Because my tracks feel whack, I want to hit the party
You want to play like Ben then give me your keys
Cause even Jen drive a Benz to go fix a weave.""

Ooh baby let me fix my weave
Touch me up and let me fix my weave

Miami, Jersey, D.C., the Carolinas, Detroit, Louisville, Ohio, to all the

To the beauty salons, and curling irons stitching in that ? hair

Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else

That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice

It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga

As I hear the record spin it seems to take over me
So I move side to side and it's something inside that controls me
As I walk to the D.J. and I say

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
""Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you and me, you see
Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you...""

But before I go, this is what I say

Messin with them cats that's said to get I had to give

And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'

I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause

'Why you gotta-why you gotta sing all these nasty records?'
And all that, but I be representin' for the ladies and
We got somethin' to say, we've been quiet too long

We ain't get mad when Prince had his ass out
We thought he was gonna turn around to the front
And have the front out too! But you know, that didn't happen
We always had to deal with-with the guys
You know, talkin' about how they gon' wear us out on records
And-and you know so I had to do records that was strictly--
Representin' for my ladies and how to keep yo man
Keep his eyes from wandering, looking around
And, sex is not a topic that we should always sweep under the rug

Strap it up, before you smack it up
Flip it, slow it down, oh no!

Why Missy be socking it to niggas like Ree-Ree?
The baddest industry bitches of the century
Hit hard like penitentiary dick
Finally admitted that we the shit combination is lethal
Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this
We parlay puffing
Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?

You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, Timbaland, I see you, baby
I feel you, sock it to 'em, goddammit

And all I have to sayyyy, is now...

[Hook]
When I sing this song I get so tear-y eyed
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've, done, to me (me)

[Missy - singing]
I, comprimised all my time
And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine
Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind
Cause you, brought the worst out of me (you brought the worst out of me)
This is, how the story goes (WOO!)
The others want to know, when it's out of control
You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt
And I guess, that, be, me

And, I am through wit'chu, you and your crazy moods
You be trippin and slippin and givin attitude (HOLLA!)
I deserve the finger things, the joy that love brings
And you'll be missin my kisses and makin love scenes
I'm better off alone, can't wait 'til you get gone
Ain't no need to keep hopin cause it's, over and done

Why do you keep comin back, time and time again
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I can not change you man

Better get them chicks who turn tricks cause I'm just too smart
Man, I hate men who lie, who look me in my eyes
Come up with alibis, for the thousandth time
I won't take bullshit, leave your ass with the quickness
Because I'm stable and able to live my life alone

Toys!

I keep my butterfly close when you ain't wanna be bothered
Don't come waking me up, cause I ain't giving you nada
Cause I got me a toy (Tooooy)
And it works for me and it lasts longer than the battery
So you best believe that

[VERSE 3]
I used to wish that you would love me
And fantasize on how we used to be
Until I discovered something better than you

You wanna come home late at night touchin' and feelin' all over me
But I don't need no help in pleasing me

"[Intro]
I know of somebody out there who had a nasty nasty
Nasty friend who wanna go around humping everybody
Can I get a ho? You know what I'm saying? So
I'mma talk about this one I had a few years ago

[Verse]
I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as loose bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin'
And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat
She was hot as da nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her
'Cause he bang bang, swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range
And make the ugly bitch sing

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph
She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson
From all the dick testing
Now I'm guessing (Now I'm guessing)
She's laying in a casket, in a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics, loosy bootie made trife
Feeling, she got the heebie geebies
Quick to give you freebies
Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'
She greasy like chicken
I don't give a cotton pick and
She can do her thing
'Cause me and her don't hang
The ugly bitch sang

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh

So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again, going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
