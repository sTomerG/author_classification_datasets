"[Intro: Watch The Duck]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money, and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're 'round me, yeah
That's why I keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're round me, girl
When you come around me, when you come around me
Yeah, girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100, when you're 'round me
Girl, when you come around me

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Imma keep it 100, I'm a boss chick, but he run it
No Michael Kors just Tom Ford
Saint Tropez, I'm like bonjour
In Spain wearing that Balmain, Lanvin, Givenchy
On the top floor of that penthouse, I got ten toes on that concrete
Keep it G with the money, I ain't gotta lie about shit
I don't need the money, I can buy my shit
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch
He know I'mma put his ass out my shit
Paid one million for that drop six
And he got the Glock in my cockpit
Them other chicks he get caught with
I'm the bitch he gonna rock with
They talk shit, but we bought shit, fly Aussie on boss shit
When he need to be, where he need to be
I tell him ""go on, it ain't no thing to me""
Gotta hit that thing, bring that back witcha
Let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy
You knew I was high class ass when you met me
My money tall, it's too bad for y'all
Y'all dough as short as Joe Pesci
I'm a fancy bitch but I'm ratchet
Not like the bitch you had, ain't never had shit
Respect that, how I come around, no run around
You better humble down
Them games, ain't gonna play none
Keep it A1 since day one, yeah

[Hook: Watch The Duck]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're 'round me
Yeah, girl you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're 'round me
Girl, when you come around me

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Bankrolls'r'us, we got it, you know how we ride
No credit, no debit, no thanks
My clique pay cash everything we buy
See me walking by with my nose in the sky
Make you be like, ""Damn bitch, can't say hi?""
Then I hop in the drop and wave goodbye
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di
Why stress myself when he not there?
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there
You know how many dudes want me out there?
Just stop thinking about it, you got no idea
Don't try me man, you know I will
Throw this brick through your wind shield
Knife your nice new Rover Wheel
That fireplace? Your clothes in there
If I know you two in there, no asking what you doing there
Imma send my crew in there, you two gonna be ruined there
You violate, I demonstrate, especially if I'm true to you
And when I come around, I keep it 100 as usual

[Hook: Watch The Duck]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're 'round me
Yeah, girl you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're 'round me
Girl, when you come around me

[Outro: Watch The Duck & (Iggy Azalea)]
100, 100 as usual, 100 as usual
(When I come around I keep it 100 as usual)
100, 100 as usual, 100 as usual

That AK-47
Bang! bang! bang!

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Iggy got that secret service, this that presidential shit
Get the busy tone when ya call my phone and my voicemail full of messages
Say you got that AK-47, well, let me see you shoot it
Eat it up, beat it up boy, don't bruise it
Put ya hands on it, don't slip, don't lose it
Bad bitches in my chat room, my chat room be poppin'
Turn that chat room to a freak show when them bad bitches get topless
Put it on Ustream for the whole world so the whole world can see it
Got that hotline, and it's about time for me to swap it out, I gotta re-up
They saying, ""Iggy, oh, Iggy,"" they wanna play with that kitty
They calling, blowing my phone up, wishing they could kick it with me
The way I'm stunting I'm hurting feelings, they wondering what I'm getting
A hustler charging all of you customers by the minute

Other hoes just crew hop, while I'm pulling up in the new drop
1-800-Bone thug
That freak shit I put you on some
You could try all night but I won't come
(you could try all night but I won't come)

It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long

You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored

But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord, if you hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
Cause I don't want none of that fake love
Cause how I'm looking at it, all of that be made up

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but I'm strong

So for now just leave me alone
I don't need y'all anyway, I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway, I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway, I don't need y'all anyway

Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
That's when I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stressing more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute, now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen
Talking 'bout no money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talking 'bout VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothing into something
So now I need money, put it all in my discussions

And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works?
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high

Asking, ""Baby how it taste? I bet it taste good.""

Got me like, ""Yeah, I'm Gucci, Ferragamo and Louis.""

Make your man act like a groupie
You like fruit? Then imagine I'm smoothie

Said he wanna blow fish, I'm hootie

Rest in peace, Martin Luther had had a dream in this hoe
And what happened is that elephant grew big as a bitch
And that motherfucker said, ""Take a sniff, you the shit""
White girl with a fat ass and a rap game, I know I make you mad
Vacays on a private plane for my own scene I hit Trinidad
I know you probably hope I'm doin' bad
I know you probably think I'm over-privileged with a rich dad
Put a check down and get my new pad, but that's too bad
'Cause I did this shit on my own, yeah
I had to pick up the phone, yeah
Make calls, leave home, yeah
Take falls, get grown, yeah
Play records for a whole lot of people
Who just couldn't see me go for it
Kept runnin' like go Forrest
I got the awards to show for it
But they still don't believe me
And they think this life is easy
Made it far without suckin' dick
Blinde girl, no pink head
Why these people all despise me?
Yet these dudes wanna wife me
I must be doing somethin' right, please
Back the fuck up, you lil' side piece, peace

Y'all one YG speak nah, nah, nah, nah that nigga brazy
Nah, nah these niggas brazy
They don't talk about the gun shots
They don't talk about the deals I got
Birds I popped, the what not
Oh, I can't spit about the block?
What, I gotta turn punk rock?
Oh, oh, I get it, they wanna see a mosh pit when the beat drop
I don't need a chick to make me pop
I just need my breakfast hot
Whether you's a show up or not
I'd rather slide my own drop

Rappers turned pop, that's why they don't speak up
I spent my last hunnid on ten of your albums
Now tell me why the fuck you leadin' us
Speak up, speak up, speak up

Unless I'm buyin' a Phantom, will never get ghost
Chordz and Stix you my brothers, you know the DRUGS code
Fuck it if it's pop this year, then raps gettin' grown
How the fuck can you complain about evolution?

And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind
Said I get my money on time, if they got money, decline

Twenty years in the rap game, man, I don’t have to make it last
That bullshit that you smoking never been in my cigar
What I'm smoking on you gotta keep in a jar
Own it to the shit and nigga pop and have a bar
With two white chicks ménage à trois
Rolling up, back to back
I need my medicine, I got cataracts
One night with yo bitch then you can have her back
Me saving these hoes imagine that

I’m just tryin’ to build my army up
But these days they shootin’ at me with a Tommy Gun
Carry the weight ’cause I’m strong enough
But sometimes the hate make me feel like I’m pulling a Tonka truck
What’s the fuss? I bought the Murda Bizness to all of them
They asking questions like I ain't talking about dressing
Are we talking about art, or are we talking about perception?
If it bangs play my record, if not, then shelf it
While others coming up shorter than elf limbs
I realize I may be the realest bitch they ever dealt with
And to be honest these rumours be all fables
See, I don’t get dropped, I drop the label
Let’s keep it very clear, I’m doing just fine
I’m sitting on a million, your bank’s flatline
Death to the haters, face it one time
You got your own dick bitch
Why you ridin' mine?

[Hook:]
Kick me down but I’m a champion
Heard them say that I'm not the one
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them
Carry the weight like a champion
Go sell the dreams to the other ones
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them

[Verse 2:]
I never learned to fail, all I know is win
The haters shoot me down, can’t help but crash land
I get up walking, they still talking it never ends
They build me up to break me down it builds me up again
On my Twin Tower shit, even when I’m gone
They gon’ pay to see where I’ve been
I ain’t do this shit alone but it ain't take many friends
Now I understand the song, many men, many men
It’s only so long, fake bitches can’t pretend
I’m gone with the wind, they can’t even catch my drift
The hate keep you from hearing, well, fuck it, read my lips
There’s some things I never do; never lose, never quit
Never change who I am, never give a fuck who gives a shit
I’m drunk off life, of course I’m swerving in and shit
I’m in the zone throne empty I’ma take a sit
And like my girl Tiny all these haters on my Tip

"[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Ain't this what y'all need me for?
You done pissed me off, what is y'all leaving for?
Oh what? A white girl with a flow ain't been seen before
Bow down until your knees get sore
Treat Neimans like a grocery store
And Selfridges get the same rapport
Ask Bey when we off on tour
Hopping out a fly whip, screaming, ""This ain't yours""
How famous can one get 'fore she get tired?
One phone call that make all the money get wired
Uh, spit fire that'll burn down an empire
20 deep in the Sprinter tryin' the Benz tires
Wave hello when I breeze by ya
Make enough in ten months I could live off or retire (woo)
But I just won’t quit
Tryna figure out which part of this you just don’t get, huh

[Hook]
Lord, lemme know if you got this, preaching about prophets
It ain’t no one man can stop us, bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess, bow down to a Goddess
It ain’t no one man can stop us, bow down to a Goddess
Goddess, got it?

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Same critics wondered if I had it in me
Now want me to play friendly
But how the hell you play friendly when the mention of my name could cause a media frenzy?
The cameras flash everywhere, make it hard to miss me
Lately, I been crazy 'tell a psych ward commit me
After any competition coming up against me
You think it’s anything better, then come convince me
Until then I’ll be leading the race
So bow down, put your knee to your face
While I make wine outta water, turn rappers into martyrs
Set it off whenever I-G-G in the place, uh
Young rapper, Goddess, y'all a boring read like Rapper’s Digest
I could never see you fall like I skip through August
I’m thinkin' bout now would be the time to start this

Put your hands in the sky, but only if you feel the vibe

I think I might marry my whip
Big quads that don't fit

Now we be worried 'bout making more millions
We used to be worried 'bout meals
I don't wanna talk to you
I don't wanna see your face
(Ay, I don't even wanna talk to you at all)
I don't keep in touch with my exes
I'm cooling the drama and jealousy
It's always who can get the best of who
But you won't ever get the best of me
And yeah, I saw you at the club last night
You couldn't even get next to me
And I had the club going crazy
I guess a girl got his recipe

I wanted my name up in bold
I wanted my name up in lights
I wanted to rock every show
I used to take pics in the mirror
I had to get ready for Vogue

Than I ever could've dreamed before
They pray for the down on my luck
But I still don't give a fuck
We live in a world full of judgement
And they love to judge us

Fall in line, this is danger for who?

Made the front of another mag, go and mount it up
And you just pulled up in a jag, that's the funny thing

Back it up, I approach with such a lavish swag
You've got a whole lot to say with such a average bag
Get the fuck out my face with your average ass

And all of my folks who done been here from jump you the ones I'ma cover the bill for
And as I get ill more, we gon' triple the order of champagne and spill more
Let's handle the real score, been wonderin' what the public got a feel for
So let's keep it real, y'all, you know I'm killing game soon as I step on the field, y'all

Don't penny pinch, I promise baby I don't need your two cents

Let's go, Hustle Gang, play no fucking games
T.I.P K.I.N.G you know my fucking name, haha
Haters drop salt when they see the king
Chip said come to London they know how to treat a king
On highways whippin bentleys to the left side
On the eastern hemisphere hollarin west side
All we do is lay low and get high
Pray to the most high, live never let die
I swear I'm super cool, still will set fire
To a nigga then I up and go hop on a red eye
Till I'm dead I'mma live like its all bad
They say it's all good, platinum dog tag
Yellow gold rolly, yellow ho know me
In beverly hills gettin me and ballin like Kobe, Swish!
Do my dirt all by my lonely get no cody
Shot 'em dead, my bitch went and took the charge for me
In the phantom tell B.O.B hit the garage for me
G.D.O.D Get dough or die answer to God only

[Verse 2: Chip]
The world’s just a pussy, fuck it I’ll go in
You can catch a hollow tip for thinking you're a king
Royalty, hustle gang keep the crown with us
The only queens around here are the girls fucking us
And the haters get skipped, 
Double dutch, TIP’s got a strap in gear
Press press double clutch
Play with the bread, meet a toaster
Need a ghost before I'm ghost
Word to the holy ghost
Yeah, I put my city on the map
Everybody’s on it, Jack’s part of the flag
Word to the union, everytime we're ruling 'em
Real talk, even Bob the Builder keeps a tool with him
Heaven sent me go to hell money
Rolling in the deep still, I need that Adele money
Went to the grammies I need six to keep my rolly all yellow
Just the same as my bitch
North to the south I be in the mix
My location on Twitter should be right in your chick
It's bed time for your career
Pussy lay down
Got a full circle of bars

Yeah from LDN to the A town
Time to make the whole world know my name now

Every man needs some Azalea
You want it, you do what I tell ya
You play on my team and get a ring back
You don't, you gon' end up a failure
I look like a fantasy, your wifey mad at me
Just 'cause hubby is a fan of me, you understandin' me?
So skip the talkin' baby, we too busy ballin' baby
Pedal to the metal and my engine never stallin' baby
Bitches gon' hate, while the critics critique
I pay them no mind whenever they speak
What they make a year, I can make in a week
I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat
See the sky be the limit when you dealin' with me
I'm stuntin' this hard, and I ain't even reached my peak
I just get money to spend it, let the cycle repeat
I'm feelin' like I got this world on my feet

You ain't down to make a purchase, tell me what's your purpose?
Go out and play somewhere, the grown folks busy workin'
Iggy independent with it, they know that for certain
You be on the internet, thirsty, prolly worse in person
Down payment for a car, I dropped that on a Birkin
You don't sit in VIP 'cause you ain't no important person
Money wrapped around my mind like a turban
Iggy got them pop titties but that ass on that urban
If I told you what I'm worth, you would throw up
So have my money on time 'fore I show up
I'm drinking PJ on a PJ in my PJs
Thinking money 25/8, no free days
If your girl dumb body, I recruit them
They ask me who you do it for, me say they youth dem
Damn right, I like the life I live
Who else you know that slay like Iggz

Never quit until the clock stops
And never die out until your heart drops
Success will separate you from the have-nots
And have all these haters at your neck like an ascot

But wait, you could do it, too, young man

It get worse before its better, that storm you gone have to weather

I only got five motherfuckers saved in my phone
Everybody else blocked
I'm goin' through five court cases, goddamn go home
I win, this ain't gon' stop
I'll be the underdog, so fuck it, woof, woof
Ain't nobody think I'd make it so, bye
You should take a sec to learn who I am
Before they talk fuck shit like a hotline
Never put my chest out ever like I'm the best
Lost friends by the loads, they didn't try to flex
While I'm on the helicopter flyin' skylines

But I do have a vine if I need to swing
Out the motherfuckin' way when the lies come
In your ass where you put your opinion, uh

You need people like me to get through your day
Got my name all in your mouth, how does it taste?
Got someone for you to meet, got someone for you to meet
Not the pinkie or the ring boy, but a bird who speaks

Say hi to the middle man, hello to the bad guy
Say hi to the middle man, ayy, say hello to the bad guy

What you mean I don't write my lyrics?
I'm not real rap, I don't talk about feelings?
You are a trap queen on fleek all summer
I'm tryna understand why it change when I come out
Is this about image? Do I need permission?
To love hip-hop, pay word to Stevie J
Can't help that I rap, oh my accent's fake?
Guess I'm Joseline, they gon' talk anyway, way
Life move fast so I drive slow
And my life move fast so I drive slow
Uh, ain't tryna say I'm not a pop star
Like Jay say, ""Ayy, you are who you fuckin' are""
Uh, and I ain't tryna change that
Million dollar bills ain't tryna change that
Never had the feelin', take a sip of this tack
You want me to leave you, along with the stacks

Better check my tax bracket, what you think was gon' happen?

Ride or die where the world takes us

You used to be everything, now that mean nothing
Thought this was poker with the cards up, but we were bluffing
I miss you, but pride won't let me tell you
Thought that we had all the time
But I'm guessing that plans fell through
Yeah, we fell off, I won't ask you to climb back
I paid twenty for that Rolly, I just want my time back
Was wrong too but I see it now that you don't give a damn
I got you tatted, you took off before the ink dried on my hands
I was down to give you the world, instead you gave me hell
I lied, tried to be perfect and I played myself
And it hurts so bad, we coulda worked on that
'Cause you say you love me, but real love don't work like that
The truth is, I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
Said I crack a smile when things get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to da-date you

[Hook]
Rolex's don't tick-tock
But damn it, baby, my time costs
And damn it, baby, my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost
I need payback for all the time lost
Said, I need payback for all the time lost
Damn it, baby, my time costs
So I need payback for all the time lost

[Verse 2]
Say that you love me, I say that you're lying
'Cause I said we could work on it, you said ""let's leave it behind""
Couldn't put together the picture I paint in my mind
So how I see you now, insulting me is wasting my time
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go
'Cause if we stay in this, then we might make it worse than before
Another hard lesson, stressing, taking personal notes
Remember sweet nothings, like baby, what's the purpose in those?
Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that
But sometimes in love, it just get like that
Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back
You know, Cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that
And for all of y'all watching, I hope that this entertain you
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you
'Cause I'm still here laughing when it get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to da-date you

You ever start to feel that home wasn't your home
Kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes
What you say ain't gotta be what you made of
Well, see your heart don't always match where you came from
Couldn't see you, so they treat you like a misfit
Because your mind clicks in another district
Call you fake but they don't know what's inside you
Cause what's inside justifies what divides you
Searching for that place right where you wanna be
That's really real where it's never full capacity
Throw that and get away, never come back, don't go the wrong way

"[Intro: Interviewer & Andy Warhol]
You once said, I hate to throw the old quotation back at you, that you thought it would be nice to a machine.
Well, I, I still wanna be.
Do you believe in feelings and emotions?
Well, no I don't, but I have them. I wish I, I wish I didn't.
But you'd like to get rid of them all together, wouldn't you?
Uh, it would be a good idea, yeah.

[Chorus:]
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo

[Verse 1:]
Used to be happy, but now shit's unpredictable
I smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though
You fucked her on my birthday and that’s what really hurt the most
You tell the truth… half way, guess thats why this unfixable
But still …

[Chorus:]
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo, yeah
I’d rather go slo
I’d rather go slo
I’d rather go slo

[Verse 2:]
When I call sometimes I wish you pick up
But most days the call is declined
It’s okay, I don’t give a fuck
You outta sight, so you outta mind
I'm doing alright know I’ma be fine
I gotta few candidates standing in line
Broke up before but I wasn’t like this
Not many regrets I wish I could rewind
Damn! We both got our lives so it's no surprise
The schedules conflict and we can’t coincide
My heart's cold, feels like I got no insides
We rushed it to the finish line, we should have took our time
You make me crazy with rash decisions and sudden movements
Can’t even enjoy a moment or pay attention to it
If I could try this shit again? Real shit I'd probably do it…
That's why it's hard to act like you someone I'm really through with

[Chorus:]
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo, yeah

"Kill these hoes with my southern flow
Looks so good and I'm flying here
Soaring high like an eagle, ho
Baddest bitch in my hemisphere

Drugs, the camp and I'll let you know
Saved every song so you can hear
I'm the leader of my circle
I'm the head of my peers
I'm the leader of the ladies
Let's get this clear
That's how we rock

10 million sold when I drop
10 million flows, think she hot
10 million hoes in my drop
10 million pounds, watch my clock
10 million years at the top
My time will start today, Nicki paved the way
Kim, Foxy, Eve, now I can't stop, uh

Get your Styrofoam cups, raise 'em high
Let 'em know it's Team Iggy, bitch, till you die
Gets your tats, get your shirts
Let the world see who running this
Let 'em know you belong to me

At the palms I drop 180

Hey, Neil, I swear they can't fade

"[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
Cuz most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
Cuz (ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]
Don’t you come here thinkin' you ballin' (oh nah)
Ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean
Smells like trouble to me

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy what a perfect match
And if we ooo, you're gon' want to pay back tithes
Cuz when you finish you gon' feel like you was baptized
See baby now you fiendin' for a test drive
Cuz you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
I got it bad for him in the worst way
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position and
I shoulda have never got involved in the first place
But second place never get the recognition, hmm
See what he doin' to me make have to shout it out
Got a hold on me, that's without a doubt
So clear now that he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters

[Bridge: Jennifer Hudson]
Just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me
Just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, knew you were bad news (Knew you were bad)

"[Intro]
Yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
That's the last thing we wanna do
We don't wanna scare anybody

[Verse 1]
Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here
I just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth
So I'm just climbing, paid off rhyming, now I'm shining, could be blinding
Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
I'm what amazing look like, now recognize it when you see it

[Hook]
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I've been counted out, I've been stepped on
I was wide awake and got slept on
I had everything and then lost it
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted
All this talking about me, just talk about me
I'm here now, they can't walk around me
I'm dedicated, flow elevated
Tell every hater hope you never play it, said I'll never make it
I'm celebrating and I'm never quitting, no resignation
I took desperate measures out of desperation
I'm the fresh face with no expiration
I know pressure make diamonds so I threw 'em off in this chain
And when it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game
Cause I'm gon' get it and that's for sure
Can't be like y'all, that's a no-go
International while y'all local, got this locked up just like po-po
Every beat get ate, that's ocho
Won't lose, oh, no, that's Yoko
Been up and down like low lows
Still make my own on my solo
Had to be here to believe it
Think like winners to perceive it
Had to let you know that I mean it
If I speak it and say keep it
This flow, that's genius
Just think about it, what I think about it?
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what?

[Hook]
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

[Bridge]
And everything ain't the way I planned it
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing
This lifestyle can be so demanding
But I take off like a plane and ain't never landing

[Hook]
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones

"[Verse 1]
Right, Iggy back no playtime
I just gave y'all some break time to miss me
So stressed on what's next
My last little bit of success ain't even hit me
So keep it light on the advice
Look at us, we must be doing something right clearly
In convo I don't talk to too many
I just talk to the fans in the songs cause y'all feel me
Now let's reflect on what we left on New Classic
I overstepped what was expected, I blew past it
So best bet is respect my perspective
Or go get your sight checked for new glasses
The fact is you combine the stats with
The history I made, the message should be established
I guess what I'm explaining in laymen's
Is ain't nothin' about miss Azalea average

[Hook]
Now we in this bitch
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch
Now we in this bitch
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch?
Now we in this bitch
Admit it get borin' with no me in this bitch
Now we in this bitch
What's a world with no I-G-G in this bitch?

[Verse 2]
Unpolished product of my environment
Tryna get the same type love and respect as peers I be rhymin' with
But everything is so one-sided, divided and biased
That I can't get a fair judge panel not in the slightest bit
In light of this, I had to write a hit to get this type of chip
Ridin' dick won’t get me nowhere and I ain’t that type of chick
That's so unladylike 'specially knowin' they be like
""Iggy this and Iggy that"" long as you say it, say it right
Right, they might be playin' but Iggy ain't
'Til Iggy faint, I just wanna fill this Iggy bank
See I emerged from the smoke without a smudge on me
So back up up off of me unless you got some love for me, right

[Bridge]
Even when my back against the wall
I still don't know fear and won't shed a tear
Cause when I think back, I've seen it all
And everything that ain't stopped me got me here so

[Verse 3]
Look in my eyes and see what I see
You know that nothin' happenin' surprise me
It's like I seen this before
This is everything I was dreaming for
Relax your mind let ya conscious free
I got expensive taste and I ain't waiving the fee
It's like I seen this before
Life is now everything I dreamed and more
And more, life is now everything I dreamed and more

And more, life is now everything I dreamed and more
And more, life is now everything I dreamed...

All this cash, cash, cash, cash, cash
I seen Sean the other day, he said
""Damn I ain't know you had that
Ass, ass, ass, ass!"", leave no questions
I'm Jolie, when I'm on that D, I have you gone in 60 seconds
These bitches don't like me, ah, these haters want to fight me, ah
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah

Polo should have been my logo, with a jockey around on my coat though
So I got to take 'em back to the drawing board
Cause it's time to make some hits for the mo'mo'
I turn up with my top missing, and hop out in a New Edition

I'm propane, this Hell's Kitchen, my campfire, these smoke signals
Sold some other shit, get these maggots off me
The best is immaculate, attach it slowly
Broads got at where you act, they acting Tony
Fuck you up in the ass, get the alimony, ugh

She don't know, she don't know a thing
She don't know a thing about me
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll

I'm a motherfucking G, and we long distance
Sipping on biscuits, sipping our tea
We flip them the bird, then let them fly on for free
Watcha lookin' at? Whatcha lookin' at?
Watcha lookin at? Watcha lookin' at?

I'm cooling in Italy
And a man could probably a tee, I'm making a scene
If they rolling the camera's, my candids come with a fee
Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomit, I'm throwing up this confetti

Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke
I'm gonna ride this wave kind of like a tube on the rope
If you don't like it, I give you something to hold
Here's a D from you to me, you can call it my own

Damn Iggy, damn Iggy, why you so illy
Sewed up, really when the pen in the needle, you gon' feel me
I got my fam with me, going ham, and that's some damn chilling
Take the night off, and with me we gon' ride off, and we gon' ride off

Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me

Takin kinda long, time is movin on, been feelin kinda strong
Love is on the phone
Ya sayin that I'm here, if only you could hear
My heart yellin' out, I wanted to compare
I know what I deserve, I demand the bestest
